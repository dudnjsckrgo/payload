PART	3
Questions	32-34	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Who am I supposed to submit this corporate merger 
article to for review when I’m done drafting it? It’s 
Friday, and the story is scheduled to be published in 
our paper’s Sunday edition. So, someone will have to 
approve it by the end of the day.
W:  You can send it to Arnold Smith. Following his 
promotion last week, he’s responsible for all articles 
published in our weekend edition. 
M:  I’ll submit it to him this afternoon, then. But first, could 
you tell me what you think of the title? Umm . . . 
here’s a copy of the piece. 
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Thank you for calling Jenkins Automotive Insurance. 
This is Bernard speaking. What can I do for you?
W:  My name is Candace Black, and I’m one of your 
insurance policy holders. I was just in an accident 
outside Austin, and I would like my car to be towed to 
an auto repair shop. I don’t feel comfortable driving it.  
M:  I completely understand, Ms. Black. A tow truck will 
be dispatched to your location immediately. But first, 
I’d just like to confirm that you’ve notified the police 
about the situation.
W:  Yes, I did. In fact, an officer is going to stay here with 
me until the tow truck arrives.
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Oh, I can’t believe Pasadena Gallery is going to 
display my artwork! Thank you so much.
M:  We take great pride in supporting local artists, and  
I think your paintings will appeal to our clients. Plus, if 
you go on to achieve success, we can say that your 
first exhibit was held at our gallery.
W:  Well, I’m very excited. By the way, have you decided 
on the dates yet?
M:  A two-week show would probably work best. I’m 
thinking about holding i t  from August 27 to 
September 10. 
W:  Ah . . . Could it start one week earlier—on August 
20? I’m traveling to Berlin to participate in a  
meet-and-greet event with other aspiring painters on 
September 8.
M:  That should be fine. 
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.	
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   What a busy morning. We’ve received so many 
complaints today about the latest update to our 
company’s accounting program.
W1:  It’s been hard trying to resolve callers’ issues . . . 
Didn’t you say you dealt with a really upset customer 
earlier, Lena?
W2:  Yeah. She was working on a financial report for her 
company this morning and lost all her data when the 
program crashed. 
W1:  I can understand her frustration, but I’m still not 
looking forward to answering more calls after lunch.
M:   That’s for sure. Anyway, speaking of lunch, how 
about going to the Italian restaurant across the 
street? My treat.
W2:  OK. But let’s try to return to the office before 1 p.m.  
I need to finish filing some paperwork.
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Can I help the next customer in line?
W:  Hello. I bought these bed sheets at your store last 
week, but they’re not the correct size for my mattress. 
So, I’d like to return them.
M:  Of course. Did you bring the receipt for the purchase 
with you?
W:  Um, I lost it. Does that mean that I can’t get a refund?
M:  Do you have the same credit card you bought the items 
with? I can look up the transaction using the number. 
W:  Yes, I have it in my wallet. Uh . . . let me just get it.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Do you require some assistance? 
M:  Yes, I’d like your opinion on which of these ties to 
get. Both of them have fashionable patterns, but I’m 
not sure if the black one will complement this suit I’m 
buying for my friend’s wedding. 
W:  Since the suit you’ve picked is gray, I think this sky 
blue tie matches it better. The black one seems too 
dark in my opinion. 
M:  Hmm . . . You’re right. Plus, my friend said that light 
purple will be one of his wedding colors. So, your 
recommendation will go better with that too. I’ll put it 
on now just to make sure it suits me, if that’s OK.
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Hi. I went to singer Farrah Miller’s concert last 
Thursday at your theater. But I was very disappointed 
that there were issues with the sound due to a 
microphone malfunction. I want a full refund for my 
ticket, please.
W:  I’m sorry about that, sir. However, we aren’t providing 
refunds because the issue was caused by the band’s 
equipment. I suggest you make a complaint on 
Farrah Miller’s official Web site. 
M:  I tried that yesterday, but I haven’t heard back yet. 
Isn’t there anything you can do to compensate me?
W:  Well, we can provide you with a 20 percent discount 
for a future performance at our venue. I hope this will 
make up for the inconvenience you’ve experienced.
Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation

position are qualified. Either would be suitable for 
the job. 
M1:   I feel that Patricia Spaulding is more versatile, as 
she’s worked on different types of studies. What do 
you think, Jamie?
M2:   I agree. She has used several methods to examine 
consumer trends, and I’d like her help with some 
marketing research I’m in charge of now. 
M1:   Good idea. Also, I thought Ms. Spaulding was more 
approachable than the other candidate.
M2:   Then let’s offer Ms. Spaulding the position. We can 
notify her today. Stella, could you do that?
W:   I’ll call her right after this meeting. 
M2:   Thanks. I know she’s anxious to hear from us, so 
let’s not keep her waiting. 
Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Elaine, I have an idea. What if our company started 
subsidizing employee education? We could offer 
financial support for workers who want to pursue 
professional courses.
W:  I don’t see why not. Many successful corporations 
invest in staff development. And based on last 
Friday’s gathering with the board of directors, our 
company has enough money in its budget to do the 
same.
M:  So then, how much of the education costs do you 
think we should cover?
W:  The best way to determine that is to look into the 
amounts that other similar companies normally 
provide. Please do some research and let me know 
what you find.
Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello. I’d like to purchase a pressure cooker from 
your department store . . . ah . . . the Cookware 550.
M:  I can definitely take care of that for you, ma’am. Have 
you ordered anything over the phone from us before?
W:  Yes, I have. There should be an account for Marilyn 
Tan with a home address at 100 Eastwood Street in 
Baltimore. However, I’d like the item shipped to  
my friend’s home, since it will be a gift for her 
housewarming party.
M:  Absolutely. Please just wait a moment while our 
system loads, and then I’ll enter all the necessary 
information.
Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  How’s the trade fair going for you? My booth has 
been busy. 
M:  Mine too. My company’s products are selling well.
W:  I wish I had more help. It seems there are more 
people at the fair this year than usual. 
M:  A staff member at the registration desk said there 
was a 15 percent increase in attendance on the first 
day this year compared to last year. However, my 
company’s booth only has two employees working 
there today . . . umm . . . me and my colleague.
W: So your coworker is all alone at your booth now?
M:  Yeah. I’d better get back. I’ve promised to assist him 
with passing out schedules for the demonstrations 
we’ll be giving this afternoon.
Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
menu.	
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Joan, we need to make arrangements to have a 
small office party for Angela’s birthday next week.
W:  Oh, thanks for bringing that up . . . I had forgotten 
about it. Do you have any ideas?
M:  Yes, I suggest we hold the celebration in the 
conference room. But before I buy a cake, I need to 
know the food budget.
W:  We can spend up to $50 on a cake. But please make 
sure it’s big enough so that everyone in the office can 
have a slice—it should be at least 10 inches. 
Whatever you buy, just bring the receipt to Mary in 
the human resources department, and she’l l 
reimburse you.
Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	subway	map.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Welcome to Smooth Beginnings, the nation’s top 
provider of beauty products. How can I help you? 
W:  I’m looking to purchase some moisturizer. My skin 
gets a bit dry in the winter. Where can I find these 
products?
M:  They’re next to the cashier . . . um, just over there. 
W:  Thanks. By the way, this new store is really nice. 
M:  I’m glad you like it. We just opened last week. Did 
you have any trouble finding it?
W:  No. I live near the bus terminal, so it was easy to get 
here by subway.  
M:  That’s right . . . There are only two stops between the 
terminal and Norton Station if you take Line 3.
W:  Well, that line isn’t running today because the track is 
being repaired. But luckily there’s another one with 
the same number of stops. I took that one.

Marian, it’s Haley. One of my friends invited me to go to 
the Franklin Music Festival with him on Saturday. I said 
I’d go, and I’d like you to come along too. The festival is 
going to be held at Carlson Park from noon until 10 p.m. 
We plan to go at 5:30 because our favorite band takes 
the stage at 6:30 and we’d like to get there an hour 
earlier to find good seats. Please call or text me 
whenever you get this message to let me know if you’ll 
be joining us. I want to buy tickets this afternoon, since 
today’s the last day to buy them at reduced prices.

Questions	74-76	refer	to	the	following	excerpt	from	a	
meeting.
미국식	발음
It looks like everyone is here, so let’s get started. As most 
of you know, our biggest rival . . . um, Dyson Travel . . . 
now allows customers to create personalized discount 
travel packages. This is a problem because it has led to a 
significant drop in traffic on our Web site. The CEO is 
very concerned and expects us to develop a strategy to 
deal with the situation quickly. He suggested that we 
charge less for our most popular tours. I’m not sure if 
that’ll have any effect, though . . . Our prices are already 
low. So, we should probably come up with some other 
ways to address this problem.

Is it hard to keep track of all the remote controls for the 
electronics in your home? Well, now you can use 
KepCor’s EX3 Universal Remote Control for everything

its signal detector, which allows it to easily connect to 
nearby equipment. Simply press and hold the Scan 
button near a compatible device to take control of it. 
Next, select a colored button on the controller to assign 
to the device. And now, customers who register their 
EX3s online will receive a battery charger absolutely free.

Hello. I’m calling from The Blue House Restaurant. 
Yesterday, we received a shipment for an order I recently 
made for our restaurant’s glassware. However, many of 
the items, like the crystal wine glasses, are in poor 
shape. Several of them have scratches and stains, but 
other items are worse. All of the large blue pitchers are 
broken. I really can’t believe it. We were supposed to 
hold our grand opening today, but we couldn’t because 
we didn’t have enough glassware. At this point, I am 
seriously considering finding another supplier. Please call 
me at 555-2583 before noon to discuss the solution to 
this problem.

Good afternoon. This is Sarah Wilkins from 109.4 FM. I’m 
reporting live from the corner of Baker Road and Central 
Avenue, where the Star Tower is being built. Traffic along 
these two major roads was brought to a standstill when a 
crane collapsed this morning. Although no one was 
injured, the damaged machinery is blocking both streets 
completely. Of course, this is causing congestion 
throughout the area. If you are planning on heading 
downtown, visit our Web site first to find out which routes 
have been affected. I have Jonathon Grant here—an 
engineer who works in a nearby office. He witnessed the 
accident and has agreed to answer a few questions now.

Good morning, Ms. Doliber. My name is Jisoo Lee, and  
I work at Standard Bank. I want to inform you that we 
have temporarily suspended your checking account due 
to suspicious activity. Specifically, a cash withdrawal was 
made at an ATM in Nashville at 12:03 p.m. on July 3 . . . 
approximately 20 minutes after a purchase was made at 
a store here in Seattle. Please contact our security center 
at 555-0848 to deal with this matter. Before you do this, 
though, I recommend that you check your account history 
for anything else that seems unusual. You can access 
this information through our online banking service. Just 
enter your ID and password as usual, and then you will 
be provided with further instructions. Thank you.
Questions	89-91	refer	to	the	following	announcement.

I have a quick announcement to make. In response to 
feedback from staff, management has decided to 
implement a flextime system. Employees will be able to 
start and finish work earlier or later than usual. Note that 
there are restrictions . . . Staff must still work eight hours 
daily, and they can’t enter the office until 7:30 a.m. Um . . .  
security personnel don’t arrive at the building until 7:00 a.m., 
and they need time to turn off the alarms. In addition, 
shifts must end at 8:00 p.m. at the latest. I’ll distribute the 
updated employee handbook to everyone this afternoon. 
It includes a new section with information about this 
system. Please read through it and then let me know if 
you have any questions. 
Questions	92-94	refer	to	the	following	announcement

OK, everyone . . . Auditions for our new sitcom Morning 
Coffee will start tomorrow, so there are a few things I’d 
like you to be aware of. First, since I’m directing this 
show, I’ll be present at all of the auditions—except for 
Tuesday morning’s. Our screenwriter, Nancy Davis, will 
unfortunately not be able to make any of the afternoon 
audition sessions because of production team meetings 
scheduled during those times. Also, please note that 
we’ve added a role to the show, so there will be an extra 
session for casting on Thursday. Information about this 
new part can be found in the e-mail that I sent out this 
morning.

Welcome to the Summit Resort. My name is Desmond, 
and I’ll be teaching you some basic snowboarding 
techniques this morning. Before we get started, though, 
you’ll watch a brief video about some important safety 
guidelines. Then, everyone has to get suitable gear, 
including boots, a snowboard, and a helmet. You can 
rent these items at the shop on the second floor of this 
building. Once you have what you need, we’ll begin the 
lesson. Since Trail A is currently closed due to poor snow

I hope everyone looked over the quarterly report. If not,  
I recommend that you do so this afternoon because we 
have a problem. Only one of the company’s software 
programs met the sales goal of 10,000 units last quarter. 
We’ve been asked to create a marketing campaign for 
the program with the worst sales record, and Bryan 
Swanson’s team will do the same for Core Spreadsheet. 
We don’t have to worry about the other program with low 
sales because it will be discontinued next month. I’d like 
each of you to come up with a specific plan to promote 
the program assigned to our team, and we’ll discuss 
them when we meet again on Friday.

Questions	32-34	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  A representative of the state government just 
contacted me regarding our recent funding proposal. 
Our request was approved, so the community center 
is going to be the recipient of a technology grant 
worth $75,000.
M:  Wonderful! Now we can finally afford to replace the 
outdated electronics in our computer lab with more 
modern equipment. People in the community are 
going to be very pleased with the news.
W:  That’s right. However, there are limitations on how 
the grant money can be spent. So, we’ll have to read 
over the documents careful ly before buying 
computers or other devices.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Good morning, Mr. Abdul. This is Alicia Ponds calling 
from Davenport Architecture. We received your 
résumé and cover letter in regard to our associate 
architect position. And we would like to invite you in 
for an interview this Thursday. Are you available in 
the morning?
M:  Thank you for contacting me. I already have an 
appointment scheduled then, but I’m free that 
afternoon or at any time before 12 p.m. on Friday. 
W:  Thursday afternoon at 2 p.m. will be fine. 
M:  I’ll mark it in my calendar. Is there anything else  
I should bring? Like a reference letter?
W:  I’d appreciate an example of a blueprint that you 
created for a previous employer. Other than that,  
I have everything I need. 
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Do you know why our investor Mr. Herman hasn’t 
gotten in touch with me yet? He was supposed to call 
at around 9:00 a.m. today, which is when his flight 
was scheduled to arrive. But it’s 9:45 now, and  
I haven’t heard from him.
M:  I just received a message from his secretary 
indicating that his flight was delayed in Detroit. 
Apparently, his departure was postponed by an hour 
due to a severe blizzard. His flight should arrive 
shortly, however.
W:  Oh, I see. In that case, we’ll have to hold off starting 
the presentation on product development until this 
afternoon, as Mr. Herman is flying in to listen to it.
M:  Yes, that looks unavoidable at this point. I’ll notify the 
research team.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Pardon me. Is there an ATM I can use other than the 
one by the bank’s entrance? Quite a few people are 
in line to use that one. 
M:  Unfortunately, the only other one in the building is 
undergoing regular maintenance. It won’t be 
accessible for about an hour. 
W:  Hmm . . . I’m in a bit of a rush. I need to withdraw 
cash before I fly to Vancouver for a business trip. 
M:  Well, the teller at the end of the counter is helping 
another customer, but that shouldn’t take too long. 
You can get cash from her once she’s available. I’m 
sure you’ll find that option faster than using the 
machine. 
W:  Yeah, you’re probably right. Thanks for the suggestion. 
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello. This is Wendy Rahn from Silver Fork Engineering. 
I’m calling about some of the air conditioning units in 
our office building. Three of them are extremely loud 
and have been distracting our employees. Could you 
please send a technician to look at them tomorrow?
M:  I’m sorry. But all of our technicians are booked 
through Thursday. With the hot weather, we’ve been 
repairing a lot of air conditioners lately. However, one 
is available this Friday. Would it be acceptable for 
him to stop by on that day instead?
W:  That would work. We’re holding a staff picnic on 
Friday, so there won’t be anyone here to get in the 
repairperson’s way. The building manager can  
give him access to our office.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Good morning. I work at Spector Industries, and we 
want to convert a vacant lot on our property into a 
garden with a seating area. Could your landscaping 
company handle a job of that scale?
W:  Absolutely. Although our firm mostly does residential 
work, we have commercial clients too. In fact, just 
last summer we did a large landscaping project for 
the Seward Grocery Store, which is located three 
blocks from your facility.
M:  Oh, really? I pass by that building daily, and I’m 
always impressed with how nice its front lawn looks.
W:  We certainly appreciate the compliment. Now, why 
don’t you tell me more about the work you’d like 
done?
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.	
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Hello. I’ve come to pick up medicine prescribed to 
me by Dr. Vasquez. My name is Marcia Chow.
M1:   Certainly. Here you are. Can I help you with anything 
else today?
W:   Yes. Do you know if it is possible to get a free flu 
shot at the medical clinic next door?
M1:   It costs $30, I believe.
W:   I see. And where exactly should I go to get the 
shot? I’ve never been inside the clinic before.
M1:   I’m not sure. Ah . . . I can ask my supervisor, 
though. One moment, please. Daniel, this customer 
is interested in getting a flu vaccination at the clinic.

Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Calvin, do you have a portable storage device that  
I can borrow? I need to move the file for the 
marketing presentation I’m giving at the staff meeting 
to my laptop.
M:  I’ve got one in my drawer. Now . . . um . . . isn’t that 
the meeting taking place three days from now?
W:  It’s two days away. But I’d like to rehearse in 
advance, since I’ll be presenting in front of our 
department head.
M:  That makes sense. Well, if you want, I can join you in 
the conference room to watch your presentation. I’ll 
give you my feedback on it so that you’ll be better 
prepared for any questions that might come up.
Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  As you can see, the apartment we’re in comes with 
two bedrooms, a bathroom, living room, and modern 
kitchen. Additionally, the Chicago skyline can be 
seen from the bedroom. Rent is $1,900 a month. If 
you’re interested in filling out an application, I have 
one right here.
W:  The apartment is very impressive. But I have another 
showing tomorrow, which I’d like to follow through 
with before making a decision on where to live.
M:  Of course. Just be aware that another potential 
tenant saw the unit this morning. Although she has 
yet to submit an application, she assured me that she 
was going to do so soon. Whoever turns one in first 
will be given priority.
Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  How are negotiations going with TruCare Medical 
Supplies? Did the president of TruCare say whether 
the company agrees to our acquisition terms 
regarding the retention of personnel?
W:  Yes. He agreed that none of our existing employees 
will be dismissed immediately. However, all staff will 
be subject to a six-month evaluation following the 
purchase to determine whether they will receive 
contract extensions.
M:  Hmm . . . Well, at least everyone will have a chance 
to maintain their jobs. Have financial figures been 
discussed at all?
W:  As of now, we’re being offered $45 million, which our 
analysts tell me is a bit low. I need your approval to 
ask the company to pay $48 million instead.
Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	floor	plan.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Roger, we have to get the auditorium lobby ready 
before people arrive for tonight’s debut performance 
of the play Going for Broke.
M:  Right, I’ve got the actors’ photographs framed for 
display. What else is there to do?
W:  Can you set up some tables where programs can be 
handed out?
M:  Sure. There are a few in the basement. I’ll ask Jacob 
to help me carry them up here. His shift starts in 15 
minutes.
W:  OK. And finally, we need a spot where fans can take 
photos with the cast after the show.
M:  Let’s put it where it was last year . . . in the area to 
the left when you enter the building, just before you 
reach the refreshment stand. 
Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	coupon.	
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음		
M:  Excuse me. I’d like to buy a pad to make my bike’s 
seat more comfortable. Do you have the Explorer XS 
Cushion in stock? 
W:  Yes, it’s right here. And you’re in luck. The product 
has a retail price of $56, but it’s currently marked 
down by 10 percent. 
M:  That’s great. Plus, I’ve got this coupon to use. 
W:  Hmm . . . Unfortunately, it won’t be valid for this 
purchase.
M:  Oh, I see what you mean. Well, I’ll still take the pad.  
I need it as I’m going biking this weekend.
W:  OK. If you’re finished shopping, I can show you the 
way to the cashier area.
M:  Yes, this is all I’m looking for today. 
Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	flight	schedule.	
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Let’s hurry, Kelsey. I’m concerned we won’t catch our 
connecting flight to our destination.
W:  Wait—look here. This screen says our flight has been 
delayed.
M:  Yeah, you’re right. In that case, I’d like to find a spot 
in this terminal that provides Wi-Fi. I need to 
download the lecture notes from the sales conference 
we attended in Cincinnati.
W:  Just so you know, there’s a charge to use the 
airport’s Internet service.
M:  Really? I’d rather not pay a fee. Well, I should still 
have time to review the notes before our noon 
meeting today in Portland.
W:  Yeah. Ms. Anderson probably won’t ask us much 
about the conference anyway. She’ll be more 
interested in whether we secured any sales contracts 
on our trip.

Hello, Mr. Richter. This is Deloris Burke from Anytime 
Optical. As a friendly reminder, you have a 3:30 p.m. 
appointment on Saturday, January 13. Also, we moved 
our main office . . . It’s now on Clyde Boulevard, right 
next door to the Devon Art Gallery. To avoid any 
complications during your visit, we ask that you have 
your current pair of glasses and a copy of your latest 
prescription on hand. Our optometrist will need to look at 
them both before conducting your eye examination. 
Please arrive at least 15 minutes early, as you’ll need to 
fill out a couple of brief forms.

And now for an entertainment update . . . The musical 
City Streets will run from March 27 to April 4 at the 
Conway Theater. This is the first production at the theater 
since it was purchased by Eastwood Entertainment 
earlier this year. In a press conference this morning, a 
company representative confirmed that the original cast 
members would be featured, including actor Gerald Frey. 
Of course, tickets will go quickly, as many people will 
want to take advantage of this opportunity to see him on 
stage. The theater will begin selling tickets on February 
20, and prices are expected to range from $35 to $65. 
And for those of you who aren’t aware, the theater was 
renovated last month, so be sure to look at the updated 
seating map on its Web site.

Western College will be holding a job fair on Saturday, 
September 14, for its students. The event will be an 
excellent way for a small investment company like ours to 
reach out to potential future employees. That’s why I’d 
like to have at least two staff members operate a booth at 
the event. Informational pamphlets have already been 
made and printed. So, those who volunteer would only be 
responsible for attending the event, answering attendees’ 
questions, and passing out materials. If this sounds like 
something you’d be willing to do, please let me know by 
the end of the week so that I can make the necessary 
arrangements. 
Questions	86-88	refer	to	the	following	excerpt	from	a

Just a quick note about the training session on next 
Tuesday . . . I know you’ve all been busy this week 
creating the newest version of our anti-virus application, 
but you should still attend the session. It’s going to be 
crucial. In fact, I’m even willing to give you an extra day 
to finish up your project, if necessary. The company has 
hired a renowned expert on Internet security to conduct 
this workshop, and I’m certain he will have a lot of useful 
information to share. You should sign up this morning, 
though. Some of the other team leaders mentioned that 
they were going to encourage their staff members to 
participate as well. I don’t want you to lose out on this 
opportunity.

Hello, this is Olga Nabokov. I live at 4209 Grand Avenue, 
and I’m calling because I’m very unhappy with the lawn 
care service your company recently provided. My front 
lawn has more weeds than usual this year, so I arranged 
for one of your employees to spray a chemical on it last 
Sunday. I was told that the substance he used would kill 
the weeds within a few days of its application, but a week 
has passed without any noticeable change. I think he 
needs to visit my home again. Please call me at 555-0583 
to discuss a date and time. I would prefer next Saturday 
afternoon, if possible. Thank you.

discuss the most recent changes to the country’s laws. 
Following that, we will focus on a handful of well-known

Finally, we will conclude by holding an open forum. At 
that point, you all will be given an opportunity to pose 
questions related to your specific industries.

For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Lucas 
Scott. I’m in charge of collecting and analyzing data about 
consumer trends. I’ve been asked to discuss the results of 
the survey that I e-mailed to customers on our mailing list 
last Wednesday. Um, we requested their opinions on our 
current line of products. Many were impressed with the 
design of our newest shoes . . . the Hornet Pumps. They 
said they plan to buy them even though they are more 
expensive than our other items. However, we got some 
negative feedback on our second-best-selling athletic 
shoes. A number of customers indicated that they felt they 
weren’t durable enough. Now . . . please turn your 
attention to the screen behind me to see my slideshow.

Welcome to the Sahara Wildlife Reserve. When your 
professor contacted us about arranging a special tour for 
his class members, we were happy to accommodate his 
request. Today, I’ll be showing you around the facility and 
introducing you to our director and some of the other 
people who work here . . . like the biologists and medical 
staff. The reserve currently covers an area of 500 acres, 
but an additional 100 acres will be . . . um . . . added to it 
later this fall. We need all this space because we care for 
200 animals from 60 different species. The first inhabitant 
that you’re going to see arrived here 10 days ago. It is 
our only animal under six months old. Her enclosure is 
just this way.

미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:   Ted, have you booked accommodations for the 
speakers presenting at the environmental conference 
on January 12 that our company is organizing? 
M:   I was planning to reserve rooms for all eight speakers 
at the Drake Inn. It’s the same hotel we used when 
we arranged the trade show last month. But nothing 
is confirmed yet. Why?
W:   Well, the Silkwood Hotel is offering a 15 percent 
discount on all deluxe suites booked next week. The 
details about the deal are included in the newsletter 
that the hotel sent out by e-mail yesterday.
M:   Could you forward the message to me? I’ll check it 
out.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Our competitor is launching a free delivery service 
next month. To stay competitive, we should consider 
eliminating the fee to deliver furniture from our store 
to customers’ homes as well. What do you think?
M:   Hmm . . . I’m concerned we’d need to buy additional 
delivery trucks. More customers would use that 
service if there were no charge.
W:   Well, we could just lease them instead. That would 
require less initial investment. 
M:   I like your suggestion. Do you believe we should 
prepare a cost projection report before we discuss 
the idea with our supervisor?
W:   Yes, let’s do that. Can I get my tablet back from you? 
I lent it to you yesterday, and it contains the report 
template we’ll need.
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Now, we can take a look at the compiled feedback 
from the recent diner questionnaire and see if we can 
find some useful information to help improve our 
restaurant.
M:   Well, it looks like a majority of guests made positive 
comments about our facility’s decor and layout. 
However, there are several complaints about the 
attitudes of some of our serving staff.
W:   I see. I think it’s best we hold a training session to 
remind employees about our standards of service 
when dealing with customers.
M:   That’s a thought. I can even share some great tips 
from the conference on the food service industry that 
I attended last week.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:   Good morning, Jerry. I have a quick question for you. 
Was your water bill higher than usual this month? 
Mine was, and I can’t figure out why. I thought there 
might be a problem affecting everyone in the building.
M:   No. It’s possible that there’s an issue with your pipe 
system. You should have someone inspect it.
W:   That’s a good idea. I’ll need to find someone who will 
give me a fair price, though. It could be a big job. 
M:   The plumber who I hired to work on my bathroom 
was very professional. Here—I’ll give you his phone 
number.
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.

M:   Excuse me, Ms. Hill. Do you have a few minutes to 
talk about the new brochure for our fitness center? 
W1:  We need your approval before we have it printed.
W2:  I’ve got some time now. I was just looking through it. 
To be honest, it still needs some work.   
M:  What do you think needs to be addressed?
W2:  I t  should inc lude more deta i ls  about  the 
improvements we made to our facilities last month. 
Specifically, our weight-lifting rooms were all 
expanded, and skylights were installed above the 
indoor pool.
W1:  Oh, thank you for pointing that out. We should’ve 
been more specific. 
M:   I agree. I can call the firm we contracted to design 
the brochure after lunch and request the changes.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:   Liwei, a few of our junior copywriters approached me 
about getting raises this year. Do you think it’s 
possible?
M:   Unfortunately, our labor costs have increased 
dramatically of late. I don’t think we can afford to 
award raises at this time.
W:   But they’ve done such a wonderful job on all of our 
magazine issues over the past year. It seems like  
the right thing to do. Can’t we appeal to upper 
management about their request?
M:   Let’s bring it up when we meet with department 
heads this Thursday . . . But I don’t think it will go 
well, since management has been emphasizing how 
high our labor expenses are at the moment.
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:   Thanks for returning my call so quickly, Derrick. 
There’s a problem with the projector in our 
boardroom. Someone knocked it off the table, and 
now it doesn’t work properly.
M:   Oh, no. We bought that less than a month ago. Plus, 
I’ll need it when I give a presentation to the board of 
directors this afternoon.
W:   That’s why I’m contacting you. Fortunately, it turns 
on, but it’s making a buzzing sound.
M:   Well, at least it’s operating. You know, I just heard 
that the IT department doesn’t have many requests 
to deal with today. Maybe I can get someone to look 
at it quickly and confirm that it’s fine.

Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   When will we be getting more units of the L7? We’ve 
been sold out of that smartphone model all week, but 
customers keep coming in to buy it. 
M:   It’s hard to say. The phone is extremely popular 
across the country, so most stores are out of stock. 
Plus, the product manufacturer hasn’t indicated when 
our next inventory order will be shipped out. 
However, you can offer to put shoppers who want the 
item on a waiting list.
W:   OK. By the way, we’ve had high customer traffic in 
the store, so I think we need another staff member to 
work weekday evenings. 
M:   Good point. I’ll post a notice in the break room to see 
if any of our employees are looking for extra hours.

W:   Excuse me. Isn’t the museum featuring a special 
exhibit about space exploration for the next few 
weeks? I heard a commercial on the radio that made 
it sound quite interesting. 
M:   That’s correct. The exhibit is called Deep Universe, 
and it includes several interactive displays. The most 
popular is a collection of instruments from an actual 
space shuttle. Um, these were lent to us by the 
National Space Agency.
W:   Wow! I’d like to check that out. Is access to the 
exhibit included in the regular entrance fee?
M:   I’m afraid not. It will be an extra $15 per person.

M:   I just want to see how your department is progressing 
with preparations for our annual clearance sale, 
which starts this Friday.
W:   There’s a slight problem. Some display racks were 
broken when our staff moved them from the front of 
the store on Tuesday. Do we have any extras in the 
back room? 
M:   Unfortunately not. We’ll have to place a rush order for 
more racks because we need them to arrive on 
Thursday.
W:   But the store manager has to approve such orders, 
right? I’m on my way to his office now anyway, so I’ll 
submit a formal request for him to sign off on. 
M:   Thanks. In the meantime, I’ll double-check if we have 
sufficient shopping bags underneath every cash 
register.

M:   Hi. This is Kirk from TeleCorp. I received the voice 
mail you left with us earlier this morning about adding 
more hard drives to the computer server you ordered. 
I can do it, but the cost will be higher. And I’ll have to 
change the contract.
W:   That’s what I figured. How much more will it be? 
M:   Well . . . The cost will be about $500 higher than my 
previous quote. 
W:   OK. That’s fine. Will the change to my order affect 
the installation date?
M:   No, I’ll come next Monday, as originally scheduled. 
It’ll take about one hour longer than anticipated, 
though. That means I’ll finish on Tuesday at 12 p.m. 
instead of 11 a.m.

M:   Paula, is your dress ready for the charity fund-raiser 
we’re attending tomorrow evening?
W:   It’s still at the dry cleaners, since it needed to be 
shortened a few inches. I’ll pick it up tomorrow 
morning.
M:   You go to Bedford Dry Cleaners, don’t you? I’m 
thinking about switching to that one, as my current 
dry cleaner will shut down in June.
W:   Well, Bedford’s customer service is exceptional, and 
they even have monthly discounts. Ah . . . in May, 
they’re providing 10 percent off work on all leather 
items. 
M:   That sounds great. Maybe I’ll come with you tomorrow 
and drop off some of my button-down shirts.

M:   Welcome to the Hartford Public Library. 
W:   Hi. I’d like to borrow this book. I have my library card 
right here.
M:  OK. And just to let you know, we’ve increased the 
loan period. You can borrow books for up to three 
weeks now. 
W:   Great. Um, I also want to check out some new books 
that were supposed to arrive on August 13, but they 
aren’t on the shelves.
M:   I know the two you’re referring to. The guidebook will 
be available on August 23. There’s a typo on the 
notice. But the other one was damaged in transit, and 
the replacement won’t arrive until September. 
W:   Hmm . . . Can you recommend another book on that 
topic?
M:  Sure. I’ll check our system for a similar title.

This message is for Amy Yang. My name is Floyd Lamar, 
and I’m an employee at the Center Street DVD Shop. You 
rented The Brothers O’Brien five days ago, which makes it 
two days past due. Please return it as soon as possible. 
We will be closed from December 24 to 26 for the holidays, 
so you should use the return bin near the entrance during 
that period. Of course, you will have to pay a late fee. You 
currently owe $10, and this will increase by $5 per day 
until we receive the DVD. So, you should act quickly. If you 
have any questions, call 555-8039.

Everyone, we’ve reached our final stop . . . Patterson 
Beach. This is where the famous scene from the movie 
Paradise was shot. If you look to your left, you’ll see the 
dock where Mark Campbell and Alyssa Perth performed 
their wedding scene. We’ll spend about an hour here.  
I know I originally told you 30 minutes, but we’re running 
a bit ahead today. So feel free to take as many pictures 
as you like and enjoy the sunshine. Afterwards, we will 
visit an outdoor crafts market near the beach before 
heading back to the resort. Oh . . . you shouldn’t remove 
your shoes when you are on the beach because the sand 
is full of sharp shells and rocks. OK, please follow me.

In tonight’s Around Town segment, we’re going to look at 
a recently completed construction project here in San 
Bernardino. Burke Industries opened its City Springs Mall 
yesterday. This 200,000 square meter facility contains 
more than 275 stores and restaurants. It is expected to 
generate annual sales of approximately $20,000 per 
square meter. Of course, the city government will collect 
more taxes as a result. The mall will also create at least 
5,000 new jobs, which is important because high 
unemployment has been a problem in the area since 
Analytic Systems moved its factory abroad last year. We 
will now take a short commercial break. When we return, 
a representative from Burke Industries will join us to 
answer some questions.

Good morning, Ms. Harris. This is Michael Banner 
returning your call. I’m delighted that you’ve chosen us 
for your daughter’s graduation party at your home next 
month. As to your question, we offer a wide range of 
dishes that are compatible with your dietary restrictions. 
Um, we have provided food for several vegan events in 
the past, including a vegan barbeque! A real triumph . . .  
I wasn’t sure we were going to be able to prepare suitable 
food for that event. Anyway, I’ll e-mail you some 
questions about your event and budget this afternoon. 
Please respond by Friday so that I can start planning the 
menu and prepare some sample dishes for you to taste.

Welcome to the Museum of Science. We are pleased to 
announce that an audio tour is now available. To use this 
service, request a media player and headphones at the 
main information booth. As you move through the 
museum, sensors on the device will detect nearby 
exhibits, causing the appropriate recorded messages to 
be played. Please note that temporary exhibitions are not 
covered by the tour, including the one on the history of 
photography that runs until October 25. If you would like 
more information about this exhibition, simply pick up a 
brochure from the rack next to the main entrance. It 
includes detailed descriptions of the items on display. 
Thank you.

Internet access should be affordable for everyone. That’s 
why Emerson Digital is offering a special package for 
people living in Creston. For just $14.99 per month, you’ll 
enjoy upload and download speeds comparable to those 
of more expensive packages offered by other companies. 
And you can try it at no risk. If you are a resident of the 
region, you qualify for a free, one-week evaluation period. 
Just visit our office at 1432 Pine Street to register today. 
Be advised that you will have to show an identification 
card that includes your current address to sign up. Don’t 
miss out on this great offer!

Just a couple of things to keep in mind this week. Our 
distribution center has a new floor manager, Brett 
Jensen. He’s been hired to manage the evening shift, so 
his hours will be from 3 to 11 p.m. If one of you is willing to 
show him around the facility later this afternoon, that’d be 
great. Also, beginning tomorrow, we’ll be receiving a 
number of shipments from suppliers. While the schedule 
posted next to the loading dock is mostly right, there’s 
one piece of outdated information. The shipment of 
microwaves is going to arrive a day later—on May 15. 
The dishwashers and dryers scheduled to get here 
earlier in the week should arrive as planned, though.

All right, I want to talk about the party we’re planning for 
our interns. They were a great help during the product 
launch we hosted last month, and I think an informal 
dinner on Friday will be a good way to thank them. I know 
some of you are planning to make your team members 
work late that night on the Coleman Industries project, 
but let’s push it back to next week. I don’t want anyone to 
miss out on this chance to socialize together. Since 
everyone seemed to enjoy the restaurant we chose for 
Mr. Sanderson’s retirement party, let’s hold the dinner 
there. Um, the one next to the parking lot on Gray Road . . . 
right across from Shea Pub. OK. That’s all for now.

receiver.
W:  I have the same problem. I contacted Mr. Bradford, 
the technical manager, and he said that the entire 
fourth floor has been affected. His team is fixing the 
phone lines now, but it looks like we’ll have to rely on 
our mobile devices to call clients until the matter is 
resolved.
M:  Hmm . . . That’s going to be an issue because I’m 
supposed to participate in a conference call in 15 
minutes.

and use a phone in the meeting room there.

talking about a shuttle service provided by the resort 
and would like to know more about it. 
W:  That’s right. We have our own vehicles that take 
visitors to destinations in the area. Plus, there is no 
charge for the service for those staying at our 
accommodation. 
M:  Is it possible for us to take a shuttle at 1 p.m.? We 
need to be at the site around 1:30 p.m. 
W:  Hold on. Let me just make sure that there is a shuttle 
departing at that time.

W:  This is Classical Chat on 104.5 FM. My guest today 
is Rupert Harvey, a cellist in the Fordham Symphony 
Orchestra. Welcome, Mr. Harvey.
M:  Thank you. I’m a big fan of your show. 
W:  I’m glad to have you here. So, your orchestra is 
planning to hold a concert on March 20, correct? 
M:  Yes. And the proceeds from this performance will go 
to the Carter Institute. Um, this organization provides 
financial support to a variety of groups in the city that 
offer music programs for children. 
W:  Great. We’ll get into that in more detail in a few 
minutes. But first, we have a special treat for 
listeners! Mr. Harvey will give a live performance right 
now.

W:  Hi, Mr. Young. This is Fatima from Carolina Monthly. 
I’ve been assigned to take your picture for the article 
we’re writing about you, and I’m wondering when 
you’d be free to meet with me.
M:  I’ll be available tomorrow at 3 p.m., Fatima. Where do 
you want to get together?
W:  Since the article focuses on your architectural work, 
perhaps we could meet at the construction site of the 
latest building you designed, the Grand Theater. I’d 
like to photograph you in front of the partially finished 
structure.
M:  That sounds good. By the way, once the building is 
completed next month, I’ll be happy to bring you back 
and let you capture images of the interior as well.

W:  I’m dissatisfied with Gordon Distribution Services. 
Our retail outlet has received incorrect shipments of 
goods from them on multiple occasions over the 
previous six months. For instance, just last Tuesday 
we received a dozen pairs of Eclipse basketball 
shoes, which is fewer than I requested. Plus, the 
company has yet to address my complaints.
M:  Considering the ongoing troubles that we’re 
experiencing with that company, I think it would be 
best for us to partner with another firm.
W:  In that case, I’l l reach out to other reputable 
distributors that provide services in the Madison area. 
Ah . . . but before I do that, can you help me hang up 
some signs about our membership program changes 
throughout the store?

M:  I’ve taken a look at your slideshow for the marketing 
presentation we will give to Upturn Incorporated in 
November. I have some feedback on it that I would 
like to discuss with you.
W:  Certainly. Let me just open the file on my computer 
quickly so that we can review it together. OK, what 
part do you want to talk about?
M:  I think you should add more content to the sixth slide 
about the results of our market research. Specifically, 
you can note that we’ve included rainforest images in 
the billboards because Upturn’s target market 
responds positively to images of nature.
W:  Sure. I’ll also put emphasis on how many people on 
our team responded more positively to red text than 
black text. That seems worth noting as well.

with Mr. Kang from Seaward Financial yet? He 
needs help finding employees for the new office his 
company is opening in San Diego.
M:   Oh, yes. He stopped by this morning. 
W2:  Right. We explained how our firm can manage the 
recruiting process, and he seemed very interested.
W1:  Great. So, he’s decided to hire us, then? 
W2:  Uh, not exactly. While the meeting went smoothly, 
he still hasn’t made up his mind. I think we need to 
explain more clearly how much time and money 
he’ll save by paying us to do the work.

W:  I just found out about the new inventory tracking

Tuesday. But its functions are a bit unusual, so I’m 
having some trouble. Have you figured out how to 
properly use it?
M:  For the most part. Reading the user manual has 
been helpful. I recommend you do the same. A digital 
copy of it was e-mailed to everyone a few days ago.
W:  Oh, really? I never received the message. Can you 
forward it to me so I can look it over?
M:  Certainly. However, it’s odd that you weren’t included

M:  Hello, Melanie. This is John Peters calling from the 
payroll department. I want to let you know that  
I noticed an error on last month’s time sheets for one 
of your employees.
W:  Is that so? I made sure to double-check all of the 
sheets against my team’s schedule before approving 
them. Which employee are you referring to?
M:  Teresa Ford. Although she is a part-time employee, 
she entered 120 hours for the month of January. 
That’s about 40 more hours than she normally works.
W:  I actually increased her hours to 30 per week last 
month, and that situation will continue moving 
forward. I already informed the head of human 
resources about it, but I’ll call him right now and ask 
him to update the information in your database today.

W:  OK . . . Well, for this month only, Package A is 
offered at a discount.
M:  But that doesn’t include the service I’m most

W:  Is it very complicated?
M:  The instructions are pretty straightforward. I’ve used 
all the bolts to attach the legs to the tabletop. 
However, one of the remaining parts seems to be 
missing.
W:  That must be frustrating. Have you contacted the

Hi, Minho. This is Katy. I just finished giving the 
presentation to our client in Philadelphia. It went well, but 
there’s a massive snowstorm here, so my return flight to 
Houston will depart much later than scheduled. This 
means that I won’t get back this evening. Would you 
mind making the presentat ion to Techworth at  
3 p.m. today? You helped create the application they’re 
interested in last year, so the presentation’s contents 
should be very familiar to you. I e-mailed you the

Over the month of August, we will be painting and 
remodeling parts of our office. This work will take place 
on the third floor, and it may be a bit noisy. That’s why 
personnel from our division are going to use temporary 
workstations on the fourth floor. Since the construction is 
scheduled to begin in a couple of weeks, preparations 
have already been made, with desks having been set up 
on the designated floor. However, staff members’ work 
computers won’t be relocated until the final week of this 
month. I understand that these temporary changes will 
be an inconvenience, but I trust that everyone will try to 
make the best of the situation.

Because the parcel needs to be signed for, you’ll have to

As we discussed in our last meeting, the employee who

will be announced today. But before I do this, I’d like to 
congratulate everyone on the sales team. After 
calculating your sales from last month and comparing 
them to those from the previous month, we found that 
they’d all increased. Several of you boosted your sales 
by more than 50 percent, but, um . . . that still wasn’t 
good enough. Our winner actually doubled her monthly 
sales by signing a service contract with a hotel chain. I’d 
like to now ask Christine McKesson to come up and

In business news, local firm Digital Solutions has 
announced plans to release the latest version of its 
mobile phone application, SpeakVid. The application 
allows users to record, edit, and share short video 
messages. It has become hugely popular, resulting in a 
sharp rise in the developer’s stock prices. The upgrade is 
anticipated among consumers and investors alike. The 
general public is excited for the application’s updated 
interface, while business analysts predict that the 
upgrade will expand the firm’s market base. SpeakVid 
has attracted national media coverage already, and 
experts believe that interest will increase next month 
when the new version of the application comes out.

should be significantly reduced. But keep in mind that we 
still need to update the customer database software this

M:  I’m calling from Data-Trend Enterprises. We have a 
client flying in from Shanghai tomorrow morning and 
would like a driver from your chauffeur service to pick 
her up from the airport.
W:  I can arrange that for you. May I have her name, 
flight number, and arrival time?
M:  Her name is Tina Ming, and she’ll be arriving on 
Flight DF304 at 10:20 a.m. Also, could she be taken 
to the Palm Hotel before being brought to our office? 
She’ll need to drop off her luggage.
W:  No problem. I’ll add the pickup to our schedule, and 
one of our employees will be at the airport in the 
morning to get her.

W:  Hello. My name is Leslie Carver from Dannis 
Incorporated. My department will be having a 
luncheon on July 2 at noon. I’d like you to deliver 
food and drinks to the eighth-floor conference room 
for approximately 50 people on that day.
M:  OK, Ms. Carver. Do you expect any attendees with 
special dietary requirements?
W:  Yes, actually. I noticed on your online menu that you 
have vegetarian sandwiches, so could I please order 
10 of those? For the remaining sandwiches, I think a 
combination of the chicken salad and roast beef ones 
would work. Also, do you offer drinks without any 
sugar?
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

M:  Good afternoon. My name is Frank Peters, and  
I have my yearly physical examination today with  
Dr. Murray. My appointment is at 10:45 a.m. 
W:  Hello, Mr. Peters. Please wait while I pull up your 
records. Also, did you by chance bring your health 
insurance card today? If so, please place it on the 
counter. 
M:  Yes, I have it right here. But may I ask what you need 
it for? Isn’t my insurance information already on file? 
W:  All the state hospitals recently adopted a new  
record-sharing system that will keep patients like you 
from having to register personal information at each 
facility. I just want to confirm that your medical 
records are in order following the upgrade. 
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Good morning, Ms. Willard. This is Hiro Kusanagi from 
Décor Max. I visited your booth at the Virginia Crafts 
Exhibition, and I was impressed with the wooden 
picture frames you make. Would you be willing to sell 
them at my store on a commission basis?
W:  I’d be very interested, Mr. Kusanagi. Why don’t  
I bring some samples to your store later this week? 
M:  Great. We can talk about prices and other details 
then as well. Um, how many frames can you produce 
each month?
W:  About 40 . . . But I could make more if I hired a 
couple of assistants for my workshop.
M:  That probably won’t be necessary right away. But we 
can talk more about that when we meet.

W:  Alonso, are you done creating the blueprints for the 
Morissey Building? Our supervisor wants to review 
them in our meeting at 4:00 p.m.
M:  Not yet. I’m still working on the presentation 
slideshow for the seminar I’m leading tomorrow on 
finding architectural inspiration. It’s been taking me 
longer than anticipated.
W:  Hmm . . . I gave a similar presentation to new hires 
last year. How about I finish the slideshow so that 
you can focus on the blueprints? 
M:  I’ll e-mail you the presentation materials in a minute. 
Let me just wrap up the design for this slide and save 
the file to my computer. I really appreciate your 
assistance.

M1:   Yumi and Brian, will Hall A in our museum have 
enough room for the Egyptian art exhibition?
W:   Maybe. There aren’t many pieces to display, right? 
M2:   Just two dozen. But they’re all large, so we need a 
big space . . . I recommend Hall C instead. Is it 
available?
M1:   It will be. Korean tapestries are there now, but our 
director said to take them down on August 1.
W:   Umm . . . I’m a little worried, since that only gives us 
three days to set up the necessary pieces. 
M2:   How about printing the labels for the Egyptian works 
beforehand? Then we could just move everything 
into the hall prior to the event.
W:   OK. I’ll grab the artwork list for us to reference now.

M:  Good afternoon. This is Carlos Tran, and I’m a 
representative from the Riverside Business Institute. 
I was hoping to reach Ms. Brenda Ling in regard to 
the advanced accounting course she completed last 
week.
W:  This is Ms. Ling. What can I do for you?
M:  I’m contacting the participants who went through the 
course to gather feedback. The responses we 
receive will help our organization to improve its 
services and curriculum in the future. Could you 
spare a moment to answer some questions? It won’t 
take up much of your time.
W:  I’m actually quite busy at the moment. I’ll have some 
free time in the afternoon, however. Please call me 
back after 2 p.m.

미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hi, there. It’s my first time selling my fruits and 
vegetables at this farmer’s market. I noticed that your 
booth is popular. How do you attract so many 
customers?
M:  I upload pictures of my products online. My blog gets 
a lot of visitors, and many of them decide to stop by 
my stall. How about trying something similar?
W:  That’s a great idea. Thanks for the advice. Also, do 
you know if vendors can get a discount at other 
sellers’ stands?
M:  I’m not sure. You should ask the market’s organizer 
about that. Oh! There he is now, talking to the owner 
of Diana’s Juice Bar.
W:  OK. I’ll do that right now.

M:  Hi. My name is Cody Tate, and I’m calling from the 
Bryant Park Activities Center. I’d like to talk to you 
about the neighborhood event you’ve volunteered to 
work at tomorrow.
W:  Oh . . . I assume you’re referring to the Bryant Town 
Carnival.
M:  That’s correct. According to our records, you’ve 
agreed to set up game booths at the carnival. Would 
you be able to work at the ticket booth for a few hours 
once the event begins as well? The person who was 
assigned that responsibility has fallen ill, so we need 
someone to fill in for her.
W:  Yes, of course. However, I can only stay until about  
5 p.m., as I have another engagement later in the day.

M1:   Maybe we could hang this painting behind our spa’s 
reception desk.
M2:   I like the relaxing beach scene.
M1:   Yeah. Plus, the blue colors match the spa’s interior. 
But first, we should ask Monica’s opinion. Hey, 
Monica. How about buying this painting for our 
lobby?
W:   Don’t we have something like that near the 
entrance?
M1:   You mean the one with the sailboats?
M2:   I hadn’t thought of that. We wouldn’t want two 
related works close together.
W:   What about buying artwork from a Web site instead 
of at a gallery? There will be more choices online. 
M2:   Oh! Have you two heard of Crafty.com? It sells 
reasonably priced works from less popular artists.
W:   We can browse that site when we return from our 
lunch break.

M:  It’s Liam O’Reilly from the Cypress Mall branch. I’m 
assisting a customer who is interested in renting a 
van that can seat a minimum of eight people. Do you 
happen to have any available? Unfortunately, the two 
we have on our lot are reserved for use later today.
W:  Let me check the database. Ah . . . yes, it appears 
we have three that would be appropriate. Why don’t  
I ask a staff member to drive one to your location right 
away? It shouldn’t take more than 15 minutes or so.
M:  That’s great. I’m sure the customer won’t mind 
waiting. Please tell the employee to inform me upon 
reaching the facility. Thanks.

M:  Excuse me. Where is the observation deck for the 
harbor located?
W:  Just walk toward Starfish Beach after you exit this 
visitor center. The deck is on the corner. Ah . . . and 
it’s fortunate you came today. The boardwalk will be 
filled with people tomorrow because of a kite-flying 
competition.
M:  Good to know. By the way, I’ll be able to see Dune 
Island from the deck, right?
W:  Yes. New viewing machines were just installed there, 
and the weather is clear today.
M:  Great! Also, I’m curious how much the parking fee for 
the nearby lot is. 
W:  The regular price is $20 per day. But local residents 
only pay $15 because they get a 25 percent discount.

W:  Did you see this section of the carpet? There’s a 
rather large stain here.
M:  Oh! What a mess! Maybe something was spilled 
during the year-end party that occurred earlier this 
afternoon. I’m worried because our clients from 
Downview Legal Associates are arriving for a 
meeting at 3 p.m. 
W:  We should use Conference Room D instead, seeing 
as it’s unoccupied right now.
M:  All right. I’ll gather up our presentation handouts and 
bring them there. While I do that, please call the 
building maintenance team. They should deal with 
the stain in Conference Room C as soon as possible, 
since Janice Chung will conduct an interview there 
later this afternoon.

Please join me in welcoming Jason Chao to the stage, as 
he is being given the Employee of the Year Award.  
Mr. Chao was named one of our marketing firm’s 
supervisors late last year, and he’s really shown his 
worth to the company since then. He was responsible for 
all of the marketing activities we implemented for Tiger 
Cars, including some of our most successful magazine 
advertisements to date. Because of that campaign, we 
have at t racted severa l  new c l ients  and have 
consequently seen our profits rise in recent months. So, 
let’s give a big round of applause for Mr. Chao.

I have some important news. This spring, our firm will be 
partnering with the watch design company Elevated 
Time. We’ve been commissioned to produce the 
company’s newest line of high-end watches. Elevated 
Time sells its watches in over 50 countries, so this will be 
our most profitable contract yet. It is a major opportunity 
for a growing firm like ours, and we need to do our best to 
make sure things go well. If the company is pleased with 
our final products, I’m quite positive that we’ll be able to 
secure future work with them.

I want to begin by saying it’s been an honor to spend the 
final two decades of my career working in the public 
sector here at the State Consumer Protection Agency. As 
the legal department administrator, I oversaw the creation 
of numerous laws that helped protect the rights and 
safety of consumers. That’s something I’m very proud of, 
and I’ll always cherish my time here. Although I look 
forward to spending more time with my family, I will miss 
working with such a skilled group of people. Finally, let 
me express my gratitude to all of you for organizing this 
party. I had no idea that one was being planned. Thank 
you.

Thank you for volunteering at our community center’s 
basketball tournament. I have a few last-minute things to 
discuss with you before the event begins. First of all, two 
volunteers should stay outside this gymnasium to direct 
traffic. While you are doing this, please make sure that 
visitors do not park near the rear entrance. That area 
must be kept clear for emergency vehicles. Once the 
event is over, all of you should help the janitorial staff by 
picking up any garbage left by attendees. OK . . . that’s it 
for now. I’ll let you know if I need your assistance with 
anything else.

Welcome to This Week in Brooklyn on Central Radio 
96.1 FM. On Tuesday, the latest phase of a redevelopment 
project in the Bentham neighborhood was completed. Over 
the last three months, an old toy factory has been 
renovated to provide studios for artists. The space is going 
to open its doors this Friday, with painters, writers, 
musicians, and other artists holding a party for the grand 
opening event. The developer of the site—who also 
converted the old Wentworth Warehouse into apartments—
hopes that it will serve to further improve the area. Now, 
we’ll have a brief talk with one of the construction 
company’s board members, Steven Godering.

Kenny, it ’s Nina Emerson. I’m calling about our

incoming recruits. You asked if I’d be willing to take 
charge of their orientation session next Friday. I just 
remembered that I’ll be out of town for a convention that 
day, so I can’t assist you. However, Victoria Styles has 
directed training workshops in the past, and she’s offered 
to help out. I suggest talking with her in person sometime 
today. Just note that her office is no longer on the third 
floor . . . She moved to the top floor when she transferred

First of all, thank you for developing the new solar panel 
so quickly. I didn’t expect the prototype to be ready for 
another two weeks. And it looks like this panel will be  
a significant improvement over our existing model. 
Assuming it functions as expected, we should see a 15 
percent increase in power generation. Which brings me 
to the next stage of the project . . . The initial test of the 
panel will be conducted next week. The forecast calls for 
rain on Monday, and Tuesday is a national holiday, so 
we’ll do it on the next clear day. My assistant—Charlotte 
Cruz—confirmed with the maintenance department this 
morning that we’ll be able to gain access to the building’s 
roof to set up our equipment. Any questions?

PART	3
Questions	32-34	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  By the way, an employee from the state sanitation 
department will be coming here to our electronics 
production facility tomorrow. He will inspect the waste 
management equipment. It’d be nice if you could give 
me a hand making sure there aren’t any known 
issues with the machinery.
M:  Yeah, but I’m busy at the moment with repairing our 
conveyor belt, as you told me to do this morning.
W:  Just let me know as soon as you’re free. I want to 
take care of everything today since we won’t have 
much time to get ready tomorrow morning.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Hey, Soojin. I’m about to head to Forest Café to buy 
coffee for our team. Would you like something, too?
W:  Yes. I love the seasonal espresso drink sold there . . . 
the pumpkin latte.
M:  I think that one was discontinued. It was being 
offered in the fall only. The café is advertising winter 
drinks now.
W:  Too bad. Well, I’ll just have a cappuccino, then.
M:  All right. And you recently mentioned you’re on a diet, 
so should I ask if they can use low-fat milk instead of 
regular milk?
W:  That’d be great. Thanks so much.
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Our department is struggling to finalize the necessary 
financial reports for the upcoming shareholders’ 
meeting. I’m sorry to ask on short notice, but can you 
work on them over the weekend?
W:  I’ll be out of town from Saturday through next 
Tuesday. I’m visiting Charleston for my sister’s 
birthday party. You approved my leave last month.
M:  Oh, that’s right. We’ve been so busy lately that  
I completely forgot. In that case, I’ll have to ask 
someone else from your team to do it.
W:  Try checking with Catherine Dawkins. Just last week, 
she said that she’d be open to working more 
overtime, as she’s saving money to go to Europe.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Hi. This is Larry Bates. I ordered a textbook from 
your store two weeks ago, but it still hasn’t arrived at 
my apartment. My order confirmation number is 
42345.
W:  According to the tracking information, your book was 
delivered almost three days ago. However, the 
courier must not have brought it directly to your door, 
since you didn’t include a specific apartment number 
with the shipping information.
M:  Hmm . . . But I never saw the item by my complex’s 
main door either.
W:  Why don’t you talk to your building manager to find 
out whether the package is being held for you? 
Otherwise, you can get in touch with the courier 
service, Package Express. They may be able to help 
you.
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello. I have a mobile service plan through your 
organization, and I want to buy a new cell phone. I’d 
like to know if I qualify for any discounts.
M:  This month, customers can sell their phones to the 
store and put that money towards an upgrade. The 
deal applies to any newly released devices, including 
the Verso X3 and the Blade 4S. However, should you 
take advantage of this offer, the amount that you can 
receive depends on the condition of the phone you 
sell us.
W:  What a wonderful deal! Oh, and I was considering 
buying the Verso X3 anyway. Here’s my device. I’m 
curious to know how much I can get for it.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  You’re in charge of organizing tomorrow’s architecture 
team gathering, correct?
W:  Yeah. I’ve finalized all the activities that are gonna 
take place. Those details will be included in the 
reminder e-mail that I’ll be sending to attendees 
before lunch. But why do you ask? Does anything 
need to be changed?
M:  Yes, actually. Helen’s presentation on modern design 
is going to be longer than originally expected, so 
please allow her an extra 15 minutes. Also, Oliver will 
be unable to attend. He must give a consultation to 
an important client instead. So, we should remove 
him from the agenda entirely.
W:  No problem. I’ll take care of those updates right now.
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Hi, Sophia. Do you know what the procedure for 
securing vacation time at our company is?
W:  It was changed not too long ago . . . Let me check my 
manual. Are you hoping to take some days off?
M:  Yes—February 21 to 25.
W:  OK. Well, the handbook says you have to fill in a 
form on the human resources Web page. Two days 
later, you’ll receive a notification indicating whether 
your supervisor has approved the request.
M:  Where exactly is the form posted on the page?
W:  Just click on the Scheduling tab, and you’ll see it. 
However, several employees have already applied 
for time off toward the end of February, so it might 
not be approved. You should talk to your manager 
about this.
M:  OK, I’ll do that now. Thanks for your help.

Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   Excuse me. I’m hoping to learn more about your 
Chinese language classes, since many of my clients 
are based in China.
W1:  Our course of business Chinese should be perfect 
for you. Oh, the instructor is coming down the 
hallway now. Jenny, can you provide some details 
about your class?
W2:  Sure. We focus on expressions used in corporate 
settings. We meet twice weekly for two months. And 
the next course starts on June 2—this Friday.
M:   Hmm . . . Two months? That’ll be difficult for me, as 
I’m traveling to Hong Kong in July.
W2:  In that case, there’s another one starting in August.
W1:  Yes, and you’ll also be eligible for an advance 
registration discount if you enroll at our institute 
before July 10.
M:  Great. I’ll sign up for it now.
Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Now that the Evergreen Project is over, let’s begin 
our next assignment. 
M:  You mean creating the advertisement for the furniture 
shop . . . ah . . . Redwood Home, right?
W:  Exactly. We first need to plan the concept for the TV 
commercial. 
M:  Maybe we should concentrate on the business’s 
selection of outdoor furniture. 
W:  That’s a good suggestion. Can you collaborate with 
Alyssa to put together a storyboard with that focus?
M:  Oh, Alyssa’s at an off-site training session all day 
today about . . . um . . . digital media. So, I’ll get 
started on that by myself and continue with her when 
she returns to the office tomorrow.
Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Ms. Martinez, it’s Phillip Gray calling from Kerman 
and Associates. Have you had a chance to review 
the revised contract we sent you last week?
W:  Our legal team is taking a look at it now, Mr. Gray. 
They’ve told me most of the contract looks 
satisfactory, but some small changes will need to be 
made to the section on licensing fees.
M:  That sounds great. By the way, I heard that your 
corporation’s soft drink Orange Lite has become 
quite popular in Mexico ever since it was introduced 
this spring. Congratulations on the success thus far.
W:  Thank you. Yes, sales have definitely outperformed 
our expectations. We hope to make the most of the 
drink’s popularity by continuing to expand distribution 
in the coming quarters.
Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	table.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Ms. Lynch, I just checked the pharmacy’s inventory, 
and we’re running low on cough medicine.
W:  I’m not surprised. We’re entering the flu season, and 
we’ve already had many people coming in to buy 
that.
M:  Should I contact the pharmaceutical manufacturers 
and place additional orders?
W:  Please do. Also, let’s get extra pain relief drugs, 
since our supply of that needs to be replenished, too. 
I meant to order more last week but forgot to.
M:  I’ll do that. And as for the pain relief medicine, I’ll get 
the one with the lowest per-pill cost, as customers 
seem to prefer that brand.
Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	map.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Thanks for calling Tuscan Sun Excursions. What can 
I help you with today? 
W:  Do you offer guided tours of art galleries around the 
area? I’m hoping to view some during my four-day 
trip here.
M:  Absolutely. Our art tour stops by the city’s three 
major museums. It takes place twice daily and begins 
right outside our office on Truro Avenue.
W:  Oh, I’m actually hoping to browse smaller galleries. 
There’s one at the intersection of Riviera Street and 
Fresco Road . . . umm . . . just opposite the theater 
downtown.
M:  Hmm . . . Our company doesn’t provide tours there, 
unfortunately. But I can give you the phone number 
of Complete Activities—another tourism firm in the 
area. They offer tours of those locations.
Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
label.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  This vending machine sells Dalton Pretzels. They 
contain very little sugar and a lot of carbohydrates, so 
they’re a great way to get a boost of energy. I’m 
gonna buy some here in the terminal before we board 
our plane. Do you want a bag of them too?
M:  Although I’m getting a bit hungry, I’ll pass. I’ve had 
those pretzels before. They’re really tasty, but they 
include too much fat. I’m trying to be careful about 
what I eat at the moment.
W:  Oh, no worries. There’re other options if you’re 
interested—nuts and dried fruit snacks.
M:  That’s OK. We’ll be receiving lunch once we take off, 
so I should be fine until then.

We’ve now reached what’s probably the most famous 
painting in this museum’s collection, The Flames of 
Clouds. It was created by Guido Mariano and is believed 
to date back to 1821. As you can see, the picture uses a 
combination of bright orange and yellow paint, which was

May I have your attention, please? Tonight’s performance 
of the award-winning play Miles to Home will begin in half 
an hour. I have some unfortunate news, though. Roberta 
Mendez was injured in rehearsal and therefore won’t be 
performing tonight. She has been replaced by Tanya 
Wilkins. Information about this talented young actor is in 
the play’s program. Just ask an usher for one of these 
booklets. And please note that snacks are no longer 
permitted in the auditorium during the performance. We 
received complaints about people eating during our last 
production, so we had to make some changes. Thank 
you for your cooperation.

Welcome to Top Science on WRP 101.5. I’m your host, 
Nina Esteban. As part of our ongoing podcast series on 
the impact of climate change, I’ve invited Dr. Luis 
Mattson from Fillmore College to the show. Dr. Mattson 
teaches in the school’s ecology department and, just this 
Monday, published a paper in a respected journal. The 
paper examines the rise of sea levels along the United 
States coastline as a result of melting glaciers. 
Throughout today’s program, our guest is going to 
discuss his findings and respond to a few critiques that 
his research has received. Dr. Mattson, do you mind 
starting by outlining the results of your research?
Questions	83-85	refer	to	the	following	excerpt	from	a

미국식	발음
One last thing . . . I want to discuss the product testing for 
our upcoming lipstick line. We posted an advertisement 
seeking paid test subjects to participate in the research, 
and . . . well, now we’ve got a problem. A lot more people 
than we need signed up. I don’t want to turn anyone 
away, though. Instead, let’s see if they’d be willing to take 
part in other studies. I just spoke to our research 
manager Beth Meyers, and she told me that more people 
are needed to test some eye makeup that we’re 
developing. She’s going to reach out to those who 
applied to see whether they’d be open to trying those 
products instead.
Questions	86-88	refer	to	the	following	introduction.

I’d like you all to meet Ivan Schwartz. Mr. Schwartz is the 
head application developer at our company’s Vienna 
branch, and he has traveled to Liverpool to undergo 
training with our IT department. While here, he will be 
shown how to operate the data collection program that 
we will be rolling out across all of our branches in March. 
As you all know, the program is quite complicated, which 
is why we’ve asked Mr. Schwartz to travel here and work 
with our staff in person rather than virtually. Please be 
sure to make him feel welcome over the next five days 
and answer any questions that he may have. OK, that’s 
all for now. 
Questions	89-91	refer	to	the	following	telephone

Hi, Carol. I just called to thank you for asking me to 
attend your dinner party on Saturday. It was great to see 
you and some of the other people from our neighborhood. 
Um, one of your guests mentioned that she ran an 
interior design firm. If I remember correctly, her name 
was, uh, Kathy Turner. Could you give me her contact 
information? I’m going to remodel my kitchen, and I’ll 
need the services of a professional designer. Also, before 
I forget . . . I just received word that the community center 
will no longer provide transportation for its summer 
program. Your children are enrolled in classes there as 
well, right? Maybe we can take turns driving them each 
day. Let me know if you’re interested in doing that.

According to a recent press conference held by the city’s 
mayor, Shenzhen will be launching a major campaign to 
attract foreign businesses. A local publicity firm has 
created the campaign, which focuses on the city’s low 
corporate tax rates and large labor market. Moreover, it 
draws attention to how Shenzhen’s growing population 
offers an excellent consumer base for mult iple 
enterprises. Although Shenzhen is already well known 
among Chinese entrepreneurs, officials feel the city has 
yet to reach its full business potential. They are optimistic 
that the campaign will generate more attention from 
international companies, as well as increase tourism in 
the region. For further information about the campaign or 
to view any of its promotional materials, you can visit

Elegant Fashion Magazine. About a week ago, I was 
e-mailed a subscription renewal form for the publication. 
At the time, I signed up for a year-and-a-half subscription. 
However, I learned yesterday that I’ll be traveling to 
France in December for a work project. Since the length 
of my stay in the country is open-ended, I . . . uh . . . I can 
only commit to a one-year subscription to the magazine. 
Of course, I would like the amount I overpaid to be 
returned to me. If you have any questions, you can reach 
me at 555-2197.

May I have everyone’s attention? I’ve got a quick 
announcement to make before the Eastern Hills National 
Park opens today. The number of shuttle buses will 
increase next month. Specifically, buses will run from the 
main parking lot to the Cold Bridge National Monument 
every 20 minutes instead of every 30. We will resume our 
regular schedule at the end of the peak season . . . uh, 
the month in which we usually receive less than 10,000 
visitors. I also wanted to remind you about the special 
lectures that will be held at the information center. Each 
week, a different expert will discuss an aspect of the 
park’s history. Um, Brenda Kirk did a great job of 
organizing this program, so make sure to tell visitors 
about it.

PART	3
Questions	32-34	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hi, Mark. Our department head wants me to arrange 
the corporation’s year-end party. However, I’m not 
sure when it should be hosted. How about December 
21?
M:  Could you think about choosing another day? The 
21st is when the Tampa Bay Hurricanes plays in the 
championship ice hockey game, and I know a lot of 
staff plan to watch that.
W:  Thanks for reminding me. Would December 22 be 
better, then? 
M:  Definitely. Also, I can help out by sending a notice to 
fellow employees. So, let me know once you settle 
on a specific time and the other details.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Excuse me, I’d like to see the 8:00 p.m. screening of 
Voyage Across Australia.
M:  I’m sorry. But tickets for that and all other show times 
tonight have been sold out. You may book a seat for 
tomorrow night, however.
W:  I didn’t realize the movie was that popular. I have to 
be at the office tomorrow night. Will the film still be 
playing at the theater next week?
M:  Yes. In fact, Andy Baker, the director, will be present 
for a question and answer session following the 
screening next Wednesday at 3:30 p.m. You can find 
out more information about that by reading the flyer 
posted behind you.
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Good morning. This is Clara Davis, and I’m having 
trouble with my laptop. Your shop did a fantastic job 
fixing it previously, so I’d like to hire you again.
M:  What’s the issue this time, Ms. Davis?
W:  The screen keeps freezing, and the computer often 
restarts automatically.
M:  Well, that sounds like a software error, which isn’t my 
area of expertise. My associate Robert specializes in 
those types of repairs. Would it be possible to bring 
your laptop to our office next Monday? He can work 
on it then.
W:  I’m going abroad for a real estate workshop on 
Sunday. I’d really like it running properly before then.
M:  Hmm . . . let me transfer you to Robert now. I can’t 
say whether he’ll be able to fit you into his schedule 
sometime today. One moment, please.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Did you hear about the policy change for business 
travel expenses? Employees will have to submit 
relevant receipts within at least three days following 
the end date of a trip.
W:  But that means I’ll need to get the paperwork from 
my recent visit to our warehouse in Dubai in order by 
today. I won’t have time for that.
M:  Don’t worry. The rule doesn’t take effect until the end 
of next month.
W:  That’s a relief. Why is the policy being modified?
M:  The goal is to improve efficiency within the financial 
department.
W:  Makes sense. Last week, the head of the division 
was actually telling me how hard it is to track costs 
when people aren’t timely about turning in their 
receipts.
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Excuse me. I checked out some novels here earlier 
today, and I may have left my wallet somewhere near 
this circulation desk. Has one been found recently?
M:  Not to my knowledge. However, I think you’d better 
visit our lost-and-found center just one floor up. 
Someone could have possibly picked it up and 
brought it there.
W:  I see. Also, I’m wondering if it’s possible to borrow 
these DVDs without my library card. Unfortunately, 
my card was also in my wallet.
M:  Certainly. We have your account in our system, so  
I can go ahead and do that for you. May I ask for your 
account number?
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  The Sporting Supplier. This is Wanda. What can  
I help you with?
M:  I’d like to ask about a tennis racquet I found on your 
homepage—the Kendell Swift XE. I’m wondering if 
these racquets come with spare grips for the handle 
or if those would need to be purchased separately.
W:  All tennis racquets come with just one standard grip. 
But we offer a variety of other grips that absorb shock 
and reduce hand strain. Those can be added on for 
an extra charge.
M:  OK. I’m interested in the shock-absorbing types, so 
I’ll take another look online this afternoon and see 
what specific options are available. Thanks.
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hi, Charlie. I’m having dinner with our investment 
consultant in Brownville in 30 minutes, but I forgot my 
day planner at the office. It contains the name and 
address of the restaurant we agreed to meet at, 
which I need.
M:  Yes, it’s right here on your desk. Is it OK if I open it 
and find those details?
W:  Please do. Is there a sticky note attached to the page 
with the information for the meeting with Charles 
Grand?
M:  Indeed. It says that you have a table booked at El 
Toro Bistro on 45 Weston Avenue.

캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Thanks for joining me as a special guest on my 
cooking show here at our broadcasting studio today, 
Wendy. I’m sure many of my TV viewers have been 
looking forward to this.
W:  No problem, Chef Hammond. So, what will you be 
creating with these ingredients?
M:  Well, since the theme of our program is Italian 
dishes, I’ll demonstrate how to make spaghetti with 
cream sauce.
W:  Sounds delicious. Um, there are eggs mixed into the 
sauce, right?
M:  Oh, you’re familiar with this dish? The recipe calls for 
two eggs. And here’s something to keep in mind. It’s 
important to lower the heat on the stovetop when 
adding the eggs so that they don’t become 
scrambled.
W:  That’s a fantastic tip! Should I add the cheese now?
M:  Yes, please. Meanwhile, I’ll show our audience the 
differences between Italian- and American-style 
bacon.
Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Kumiko, do you know where I can find a copy of the 
study our research department conducted on health 
care devices? I need data from it to make another 
report.
W:  I’ve got a printout of that in my file cabinet right here. 
By the way, are you going to the Heart and Lung 
Foundation’s annual charity fundraiser on May 4? Or 
will you be too busy working on this project?
M:  I requested a deadline extension. I heard that there 
will be many industry professionals attending the 
fundraiser, so I don’t want to miss it. It would be a 
great opportunity to network with them.
W:  Definitely . . . If you haven’t registered yet, I can do it 
for you.
Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  You did a great job creating these charts about our 
export trends. Our team leader wants you to make a 
presentation on them at the Manila branch next 
week.
M:  That’s great. But will I have enough time to secure a 
visa for business travel before then? It took longer 
than I anticipated to get one the last time I went 
abroad.
W:  I’ve already spoken with the head of human 
resources about that. He was informed by the 
embassy that the visa approval process can be 
completed in under a week.
M:  OK. Then, could you e-mail me the presentation 
template you made for last week’s audit meeting?  
I liked the design of it and want to use it.
Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W1:  This has been an excellent year for our company.
W2:  Without a doubt. We’ve increased the number of 
jobseekers who we have helped find work by almost 
25 percent.
M:   What’s more, we’ve established strong relationships 
with major employers.
W2:  Yeah. Consistent dealings with enterprises such as 
South Bend Corporation will be central to our 
success moving forward.
W1:  Is it true that South Bend has contracted us again to 
find more engineering interns?
M:   That’s right.
W2:  Do you know the number of positions they need 
filled?
M:   Not exactly. I’m guessing five or six. What I do know 
is that the contract we signed gives us four weeks to 
find suitable applicants.
W1:  That should be a comfortable amount of time to 
work with.
Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
coupon.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Shane, the IT team was supposed to update the Web 
site yesterday to include information about our new 
Oceans Alive line of soap, but it hasn’t been done 
yet.
M:  I forgot to tell you. They’re gonna finish this afternoon, 
by . . . um . . . 3:00 p.m. at the latest.
W:  OK, I’ll check it then. Is there anything that needs to 
be done for the product release event being held at 
SuperSmart at the end of next month?
M:  Of our new products, the shampoo, hand soap, and 
face cleanser are made of organic ingredients, but 
the body wash isn’t. The current coupon must be 
modified to ensure it’s valid for the entire line.
Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
and	graph.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:   Gina, has the environmental assessment that Skylark 
Incorporated commissioned our research firm to 
conduct been completed?
W:   It has. I was in charge of carrying it out, and 
everything went smoothly.
M:   Good. If I remember correctly, the company is 
concerned with rainfall levels.
W:   That’s right—in four counties that it’s considering 
constructing an amusement park.
M:   So, I assume you recommend that the firm build at 
the driest location of the ones analyzed.
W:   No, actually. That one isn’t suitable, since land costs 
there exceed Skylark’s budget. As a result, we 
recommended the next best option.

Cynthia, it’s Haley Vincent. I know you’re busy preparing 
for the convention in Orlando you’ll be attending on 
behalf of our investment company, but I could really use 
your help. I’m presenting some information about a 
couple of stocks to a client on Monday. I’m a little nervous 
because I’ve never done that before. It’d be great if you 
could go over my notes and visual materials with me 
beforehand. I want to make sure everything is in order. 
Oh, also, do you happen to know of any good vegetarian 
places in town? I might go for lunch with the client after 
the meeting, and he doesn’t eat meat. Thanks in 
advance, and I’ll talk to you soon.

Thank you all very much for being here to celebrate the 
release of our company’s latest device, the Access 
Portable Charger. I would like to give Patricia Sanderson 
from the design team special praise today. She came up 
with the idea to include a flashlight function in the 
charger. This feature has proven popular with online 
reviewers who were given the device in advance. They 
say it makes this the perfect charger for a camping trip, 
which should result in more sales. Now, please turn your 
attention to the screen at the front of the room . . .  
A commercial for the Access Portable Charger will air on 
several major TV networks starting tomorrow, and I’d like 
to give you a sneak preview.

Hello, Mr. Holster. This is Julie Thompson from Beaumont 
Industries. You did very well during the interview on 
Thursday. Our CEO was impressed with your idea about 
how to sell more of our products in the Chinese home 
appliance market. As a result, I’m pleased to inform you 
that you’ve been selected to take over as manager of our 
Beijing branch. I’ll e-mail you the contract today. If you 
decide to accept the terms, please sign it and bring it to 
my office. I don’t want to rush you, but . . . um, the current 
manager will be retiring in three weeks. Obviously, we’d 
like you to spend a few weeks working with him. Call me 
back at 555-0393 if you have any questions.

OK . . . My name is Sarah Edwards, and I’ll be showing 
you around our tire manufacturing facility today. As new 
employees, it’s important that you be familiar with the 
various sections. Now, we usually visit the tire testing 
laboratory first during these orientation tours. But, since 
researchers are currently wrapping up an urgent study, 
I’ve been asked to do the tour in reverse order today. So, 
we’ll start by heading to the viewing deck of our assembly 
line room. Throughout the tour, please refrain from 
placing your hands or fingers on any of the machines. 
Are there any questions before we begin?

Felicity, this is Pedro. Have you seen today’s edition of 
the Santa Cruise Herald ? It features an article about our 
bistro! The popular food critic Rebecca Clay wrote the 
piece. Overall, her review was very positive! Although 
she stated that our chocolate cake was a bit too sweet, 
she said the steak and appetizer she ordered were 
cooked to perfection. You know, Ms. Clay has very high 
standards. It will probably result in a lot more customers 
for us. Could you add this review to our social media 
page today? I want as many people as possible to read 
it. Thanks!

I’d like to start by saying that it’s a great honor to be able 
to participate in this lecture series at James College. 
Several speakers have already given excellent talks, and 
I hope that you’ll find mine as engaging as theirs. Now . . . 
the focus of my lecture is the impact that fiction has on 
society. Specifically, I’m going to look at how one popular 
novel . . . um, The Looking Glass by Jack Coyle . . . led to 
several reforms to the legal system. If you haven’t read

Attention, everyone. Before we open today, I just want to 
remind you that our clothing store is having a sale this 
week in honor of the holidays. Make sure to tell 
customers that over 20 of our best-selling sportswear 
items are marked down. The display has been set up in 
the aisle closest to the main entrance, so it will be the 
first thing people see when they enter the store.  
Oh . . . one more thing. We’re going to close down for two

area can be expanded. I’ll announce the dates tomorrow 
after I have met with a representative of the interior 
design firm doing the work.

Before we wrap up, I’d like to talk about how our four 
stores are doing. I went through the figures in our 
quarterly sales report yesterday, and . . . well, there’s 
good news and bad news. The Kingston branch 
continues to do well. It exceeded $30,000 in revenue 
every month last quarter. In addition, the Albany branch 
has improved. Sales have increased each month since 
Harry Ferguson took over as manager in June. I’m 
concerned about the Bethany and Newark locations, 
though, because sales have declined since they opened 
in August. I’m going to pass out the report now. Please 
look through it and then come up with some suggestions 
for our next meeting on how to turn things around.

Ever since we started working on the Raymon Arena 
Project last month, things have been very busy. The tight 
deadlines have created problems for some of you 
architects, which we need to address. If you look at this 
flow chart, you’ll see that our normal work process for 
drafting blueprints includes five steps. However, for the 
rest of this project, I want you to draft blueprints right 
after meeting with clients. I think eliminating one step will 
expedite the work process. Now, I want to say a few 
things about a new city regulation that we need to take 
into account when designing the stadium. It’ll only take a 
few minutes.

영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Now that we’ve finished weeding the existing 
flowerbed, the new rose bushes must be planted 
along the front of the customer’s house. This task will 
take us a couple of hours at most to complete, so 
we’ll be done with it by lunchtime.
M:   OK, but before we unload the plants, holes need to 
be dug for the bushes. I’ll pull our shovels and work 
gloves out of the truck.
W:   Could you also bring over the small cart? We’ll use it 
to carry away the excess dirt.
M:   Oh! I didn’t remember to pack that this morning. I’d 
better go get it from our company’s shed. Sorry about 
that.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:   Welcome to Harvey Home Goods. How can I help 
you?
W:   Yes. I need hooks that adhere to the wall—not ones 
that are drilled in—to hang paintings in my apartment.
M:   Those are in Aisle 13, which is where we keep 
hardware and fixtures. Is there anything else I can 
give you a hand locating?
W:   Thanks, but I’m pretty sure I remember where the 
other products I need are located.
M:   All right. Just in case you have trouble finding other 
products, there’s a . . . um . . . computer that you can 
use to search for store merchandise. The machine 
indicates where specific goods are shelved as well as 
whether they’re in stock. It’s situated near the front 
doors.
Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   OK, Mr. Mattson, you’ve now seen our renovated 
locker rooms, lobby, and concession area. What do 
you think so far?
M:   I must say, I’m glad I came here today to check out 
the renovations that were made to the stadium. It 
looks like the money I invested in this facility has 
been put to good use. The new court is especially 
impressive. The Hawks’ players must be very 
pleased with the results.
W:   Absolutely. In fact, many commented on how nice the 
court is after practicing on it two days ago. Now, if 
you follow me this way, I’ll show you around the new 
luxury seating area, which only VIP guests will be 
able to use for our home games.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   Jackie, do you have a comprehensive list of our 
clients’ e-mail addresses? I seem to have lost mine.
W:   Not on hand, but why don’t you look them up on our 
new online marketing database?
M:   Oh . . . I didn’t realize that was possible.
W:   It is. A trainer from the IT department taught our team 
members how to get those types of details from the 
database during last Tuesday’s workshop.
M:   The session sounds like it was very helpful. I wish  
I had made it, but I was in Richmond for the 
International Advertising Conference.
W:   Yeah, it was quite educational. If you want, I can tell 
you more about it during our break. 
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Thank you for setting aside some time to talk with 
me, Mr. Gabo. Now, I’ll explain why your retail outlet 
should stock the DirtDuster vacuum cleaner. First, 
the DirtDuster has a motor attached to the wheels, 
making it self-propelled. Plus, it can be used on hard 
surfaces as well as carpets.
M:   I don’t know. We already have the SwiftClean, which 
works well on wood floors. 
W:   But unlike the SwiftClean, the DirtDuster is 
guaranteed not to leave scratches on any surfaces. 
Consumer polls indicate that people really appreciate 
this aspect of the vacuum.
M:   Well, I’d like you to demonstrate how the machine 
operates before I decide. You can use it on the floor 
in our staff kitchen, just down the hall.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.

M1:   Look at this. Someone must have accidentally 
poured a beverage on the lobby sofa.
M2:   Yeah, I see what you mean. It still looks pretty wet, 
so it probably happened recently.
W:    We should let the hotel receptionist know, so it can 
be dealt with.
M2:   OK. I’ll tell them about it now while we wait for our 
rooms to be prepared for us.
W:    And could you ask them when the pool closes? I’d 
like to swim this evening before I head out for the 
music festival.
M1:   Unfortunately, the singer we want to see starts 
performing at 8:30 p.m.—just an hour from now. So, 
I don’t think we’ll have time.
Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   Good morning, Michaela. Do you have all the 
information you’l l need to make a notice for 
passengers about the subway system’s new transit 
cards?
W:   I think so. But just to confirm, the cards will be able to 
hold up to $500 worth of credit, right?

M:   Correct. And funds can be added to them at the 
automated machines in each station. Riders can also 
put money on their cards by making an account on 
the transportation authority’s Web site.
W:   Great. Is there anything else that we need to tell 
people about?
M:   The upcoming closure of Line 5 tomorrow, from  
10 a.m. until noon.

Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Good afternoon, Vincent. I want to let you know that 
Martin Marquez, the recently appointed manager of 
the Northeast district, is expected to come to our 
headquarters. The visit will give him an opportunity to 
acquaint himself with our CEO. He’ll arrive on 
November 3—one month from now.
M:   Hasn’t a consultant been hired to give a talk about 
productivity to some of our staff on that date? If so, it 
might be hard to fit everything into the schedule, as 
there will be many activities going on.
W:   I’ve actually requested that Mr. Marquez stop by on 
the same day so he can attend the lecture. I think 
he’d benefit from it because it will be targeted at 
middle management.
Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   Jake and I have been asked to take five workers who 
are visiting from our partner corporation in Japan out 
next week. And we’re struggling to think of something 
fun to do with them rather than simply dining at a 
fancy restaurant.
M:   How about renting a boat and taking them sailing for 
an evening? If you go around sunset, you can enjoy 
views of the Miami cityscape.
W:   That’s a wonderful suggestion, but would our boss 
approve something so costly?
M:   It’s more affordable than you’d expect. Boats can be 
rented from local businesses for as little as $1,200 a 
day. Our company has spent more than that on 
expensive meals for similarly sized groups.
Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

W:   This is Grace from Yellowstone Apartments’ 
management office. May I speak to Jim Risen?
M:   This is Jim.
W:   Mr. Risen, you own a blue Dent Razor with the 
license plate number 124FGA, right? If so, your car is 
blocking the garbage bins in the parking lot, which is 
an issue.
M:   I’m sorry about that. There were no vacant spaces in 
the lot when I returned home last night.
W:   I see. Well, since that isn’t an authorized spot, I’ll 
need you to move the car immediately, especially 
since trash is being collected today.
M:   Ah . . . I apologize. I’ll be at work until 5 p.m. But I can 
move it afterward.
W:   In that case, I’m sorry to inform you that your car will 
have to be towed. That’s the building policy.

M:  You’ve reached Frost Beauty. Adrian speaking.
W:  Hello. Will your salon’s current special offer on 
beauty treatments continue throughout this month?
M:  We actually have sales on two services each month. 
For this month . . . ah . . . April, we’ll be discounting 
nail art and hair dyeing.
W:  Perfect. I bought a box of brown dye in March, but it 
didn’t work well. So now I need my hair to be recolored. 
Can I make an appointment for 4 p.m. today?
M:  Yes. I should also mention that we’ll have a booth at 
Denver’s Professional Salon Expo on April 20. There 
will be promotions on various hair and nail products 
that day, so you should come by.
Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and

호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:   During Wednesday’s hiking trip, let’s rest and have a 
picnic lunch before reaching the observation point on 
Mt. Evans.
W:   Great suggestion. I can swing by a convenience 
store and buy some snacks and soft drinks for us. I’ll 
just do that on my way to meet you at Grove Station 
on Wednesday morning.
M:   Sounds good. I’ll pack sandwiches too. How about 
having our picnic at a waterfall alongside Ridge 
Road?
W:   I recently heard that path is blocked off. Apparently, 
last week’s storm knocked down some large trees on 
it that have yet to be cleared away. But there’s 
another spot at the intersection of Breeze Road and 
Peak Road. I think it’ll be comfortable there.

M:   Hannah, did you end up ordering new jackets to be 
used in the photo shoot for our magazine’s October 
issue?
W:   Yes, Raymond. They’ll be delivered on August 16.  
I also submitted a complaint about the shirts that 
arrived on August 9. I mentioned that they had tears 
in them in an e-mail to Nextwear’s manager, Ken 
Powers. He responded a few days later and attached 
a discount coupon.
M:   Nicely done. Oh, by the way, have you received an 
e-mail from the photographer, Linda Wright? She had 
a question about whether she can be compensated 
for the cost of her taxi ride to the shoot location.
W:   I replied to that right after this morning’s press 
conference regarding our October edition.

T-shirts that my firm is designing for your organization 
are supposed to be ready by this Thursday, they will not 
be done by then. One of our staff members was sick the 
last two days, so the work is taking longer than expected 
to finish. As a result, we won’t be able to send the 
completed products to you until Friday. I’m very sorry, 
and we intend to take 10 percent off your final bill to 
make up for the delay. If you have any inquiries, please 
reach out to me. I’d be happy to answer them. 
Questions	74-76	refer	to	the	following	announcement.

I have an important announcement for all administrative 
staff. Over the weekend, a technician installed a new 
operating system on all of the computers in our clinic. 
Unfortunately, some data was lost in the process. Patient 
medical records were not affected, but the schedule for 
the upcoming week was accidentally deleted. So, we 
have to contact our patients immediately to find out the 
dates and times of their appointments. This is currently 
our top priority, as we don’t know who has an 
appointment tomorrow. Our lead receptionist—Janet 
Lee—will now hand out a list of patients and their contact 
information. You each will be assigned 70 of them to call.

Hello, Mr. Hong. It’s Denise Reynolds. I may have found 
a suitable tenant for the apartment you are trying to 
sublease through my firm. A visiting researcher at Forest 
University named Brad Patterson contacted me about it. 
He wants to rent your home until September 1. Um, you 
asked me to find someone to take the apartment until the 
end of September, but . . . um, few people have shown 
interest. This is the best I can do. Mr. Patterson would 
like to visit your unit this week. I know you work on 
Thursday and Friday, so how about on the weekend? He 
mentioned that he was free on Saturday afternoon. Call 
me at 555-0394 to let me know what time would be best.

This message is for Richard Brendholt. My name is 
Emma Compton, and I’m the principal at Charleston 
Elementary School. I’m calling because we’re hosting a 
Career Day early next month as a way of introducing 
students to different vocations that they could possibly 
pursue in the future. It would be wonderful if you could 
send a representative from your fire station to the event. 
Many of our pupils find your line of work fascinating. I’m 
certain that they’d appreciate hearing about the duties 
and responsibilities that emergency personnel deal with 
on a daily basis. The person you send will need to give a 
10-minute talk about a firefighter’s job and demonstrate 
the gear that is used. If you’re interested in participating, 
please let me know by Monday, March 23. Thanks.

In local news, the Meyerville city council voted to tear 
down the historic city hall building on July 12. The 
decision comes after an inspection last year uncovered 
cracks in the foundation. For months, the government 
debated whether to undertake costly renovations or 
simply demolish the facility. Mayor John Hamilton held a 
press conference this morning, during which he 
announced plans to build a public park in the building’s 
lot. The city council will hold a special session to discuss 
the design of the new park this Friday at 7 p.m. at Fairview 
High School. Residents are encouraged to attend and 
share their ideas.

The Snow and Ice Festival has grown considerably in 
recent years, and it now attracts many visitors from 
overseas. This increase in the number of international 
travelers has a very positive impact on Brenton City’s 
economy. Your goal for today is to figure out how to 
promote the festival to foreign tourists and continue this 
trend. Just keep in mind that most guests find the snow 
sculptures and ice palace to be the two most impressive 
features of the festival. So, those attractions should be 
emphasized in our campaign. All right, I’d now like 
everyone to split up into small groups and brainstorm 
ideas. Then, in about half an hour, break for lunch.

unhappy with one of the company’s products. This is 
because handling a complaint well can actually lead to 
increased customer satisfaction and loyalty. To better 
demonstrate this point, I’d like to do a simple role-play 
exercise. One of you will be an upset customer, and I’ll 
be the company representative. Pay close attention to 
how I deal with the situation by validating the other 
person’s experience. You may be surprised by the 
results. Hopefully, you will use this technique when 
interacting with customers.

My name is Janis Lyle, and I rented a car from your 
company when I visited a client in Manchester last week. 
While filling out an application for reimbursement from my 
company, I noticed an error on my receipt. I was told that 
if I upgraded to a larger vehicle, I would receive the 
navigation system for free, but I realize now that I was 
charged for it. I’d like to have that amount refunded to my 
credit card. In addition, I . . . ah . . . I’ve got one more 
request. Your Web site mentions that your company has 
a rewards program. Could you send me a brochure that 
describes the benefits of membership? I’m going to be 
taking a lot of business trips this year, so I might sign up. 
Thanks.

W:  I just heard that Malinda can’t stay until 5 p.m. Her 
son isn’t feeling well, so she has to leave work early 
in order to get him from school. Would you be able to 
cover her duties?
M:  Sure. But can you be more specific about what I’ll 
need to do?
W:  She’s currently checking in gym members and 
answering phone calls at the main desk, so I’d like you 
to do that. Seeing as you used to be a receptionist at 
an advertising company, you should be able to handle 
everything.
M:  Well, I’m not very familiar with our registration 
system, but I’m sure I’ll manage.
Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  It seems as if more people have been stopping by 
our store in recent weeks. That’s probably because 
we’ve started selling albums that are hard to find on 
the Internet.
M:  Yes, I think you’re right. But we’re still losing a lot of 
customers to online music retailers. To ensure that 
people keep coming, we should ask some regional 
bands and singers to appear here at our business.
W:  Funny you should suggest that. I’ve already reached 
out to several jazz and blues musicians in the area to 
see if they could come and sign autographs here. 
That’s what many customers indicated they want in 
our satisfaction survey.

W:  Excuse me. I’d like to leave my car in this indoor 
parking lot for a couple of hours while I run some 
errands. My husband works at a dental clinic down 
the street, and he gave me his parking pass. Can  
I use it here?
M:  Unfortunately, it looks like your husband’s pass 
expired two days ago. You’ll have to pay to use our 
space.
W:  Oh, OK. How does the payment process work?
M:  The fee for parking is $3.50 an hour. Here . . . I’ll print 
a new ticket for you. When you leave, you can insert 
it into the machine located near the exit and pay 
using cash or credit card.
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

W:  Tyler, have you read the quarterly sales report yet?
M:  No. I’m planning to look through it on Thursday.  
I have to fly to Seattle this afternoon for . . . um . . . a 
trade exhibition, and I won’t be back until Wednesday 
evening. Why? Is there a problem?
W:  Actually, there is. Sales of the company’s latest 
dishwasher model are much lower than expected. 
The CEO wants our team to develop some new 
marketing strategies and present them tomorrow 
morning. We don’t have much time to prepare, so  
I could really use your assistance.
M:  I’ll take a later flight, then. This sounds important, and 
I don’t want to let the team down.

W:  I’m thinking of getting lunch at the cafeteria in our 
office building today. Do you want to join me?
M:  No, thanks. I ate there when I started working here, 
and the food wasn’t very good. I would prefer to dine 
at a restaurant.
W:  Did you know that the food service company at our 
facility was changed last month in response to 
feedback from staff? Beatrice Dining now provides 
meals. I find their dishes to be delicious.
M:  I probably missed that piece of news while I was on 
vacation three weeks ago. In that case, I’d be happy 
to come along. Just let me finish writing this e-mail 
message first.

W:  Walter, I need you to update the staff manual for our 
investment bank’s stock market research software. 
Here’s a copy of the current handbook.
M:  Thanks. But . . . ah . . . when does the document 
need to be completed?
W:  You’ll have three days to work on it. Also, you should 
make revisions based on the version of the software 
that our IT workers are developing now. I asked the 
team to provide you with a list of changes to the 
program.
M:  Got it. But can I look at the manual in an electronic 
format instead of this printout? It will be easier for me 
to refer to that.

M:  My name is Stanley Coburn. When I logged in to my 
library account today, I saw that I have an overdue 
book. But I never received a voice mail reminder 
about this. I’m a little upset about the situation.
W:  We switched to sending notices by e-mail last month, 
Mr. Coburn. You should’ve received a message 
about the development.
M:  Really? I check my e-mails regularly, and I never 
received one. Maybe the library hasn’t been using my 
correct e-mail address. 
W:  I apologize for the inconvenience. Umm . . . here’s 
what I can do . . . If you return the book today, you 
won’t have to pay a late fee.

W:   Before we wrap up this meeting, let’s talk about the 
position we need to fill in the bookkeeping department. 
After going through the applications, I think Sheryl 
Johnson looks promising.
M1:   I agree. I was really impressed by her responses 
during the interview on Monday. What do you think, 
Dave?
M2:   I don’t know. She doesn’t have much experience 
working in the financial field.
W:   It shouldn’t be an issue, though. It’s an entry-level 
position.
M1:   Right. She’ll receive on-the-job training.
M2:   That’s a good point. I don’t have any objections to 
hiring her, then.
W:   OK. But I should talk to the department head before 
making a final decision. I’ll do that now.

M:  Jasmine, did you hear that loud party in the apartment 
upstairs last night?
W:  Yeah. I had trouble sleeping because of it. I’m going 
to complain to the building management office.
M:  It’s a national holiday, so the office is closed today.
W:  Are you serious? That means I’m going to lose more 
sleep this weekend.
M:  Well, you could put a note on the door of the apartment 
upstairs.
W:  I suppose I can try that first. Unit 74 is the one right 
above us, isn’t it? I wanna be sure I put the note on 
the proper door.

W:  Hi. I’d like to buy a watch as a gift for my assistant, 
since he was really helpful while I was creating my 
latest clothing line.
M:  Certainly. Our store has a number of great choices. For 
instance, this piece has a leather band and costs $145.
W:  I really like that. But . . . It looks like the face on it is 
cracked. See here? Do you have any others in stock? 
If so, I’ll take it.
M:  My apologies. Yes, let me grab another from our 
back room.
W:  By the way, I’d appreciate it if you could gift-wrap it 
too. That’ll save me the hassle of doing it myself.

M:   Do you know why we’re shutting down rides in the 
park an hour early tonight?
W1:  There will be fireworks in the main plaza this 
evening.
M:   I didn’t know about that. Did you, Amy?
W2:  Sure did. This month, we’re celebrating the first 
anniversary of our opening. As a result, there’s a 
special event each week. The schedule is posted in 
the staff break room.
M:   Oh, odd. I never saw that throughout the week.
W1:  I see. Well, it’s in there. OK, we’d better get back to 
work. Don’t forget to place closing signs near the 
ride entrances in 20 minutes.

W:  Josh, I heard you’re staying late tonight to help with 
the marketing department’s relocation to the fifth 
floor.
M:  Yeah. I’m setting up the computers. I was given this 
list detailing which desks I’m supposed to set up. 
However, it includes only 25 staff members despite 
there being 30 in the department. I need the rest of 
the information to finish the job.
W:  Why don’t you call the five employees who aren’t 
included in the list and ask which workstations they’re 
moving to?
M:  I don’t know their names, and our online directory 
doesn’t include employees’ departments.
W:  Well, everyone in marketing has an extension starting 
with nine. Just sort by extension number, and you’ll 
be able to see everyone in that department.

M:  Are you going to the Eastville Food Festival, Priscilla?
W:  You bet! I bought my ticket today. I’m surprised they 
raised the prices this year, though.
M:  Fortunately, I  belong to the World Culinary 
Organization, so I got a $5 discount. Members pay 
$10 for a one-day pass and $15 for a two-day pass.
W:  Lucky you. Did you hear that they will be holding a 
cooking competition on Sunday afternoon? An 
announcement was added to the Web site yesterday. 
Apparently, several international chefs will be 
participating.
M:  Really? I’d love to watch that, but my parents are 
staying at my house from Sunday to Monday, and we 
already have arrangements then. So I’ll have to skip it.

Attention, Flight 876 passengers. This is your captain 
speaking. Thanks to some favorable air currents, we will 
reach Los Angeles approximately 20 minutes ahead of 
schedule. So we will arrive at 5:20 p.m. local time instead 
of 5:40 p.m. The weather at our destination is partly 
cloudy and is expected to stay that way for the rest of the 
day. Since this is an international flight, many of you will 
need to submit an immigration form upon arrival, so I 
suggest filling it out now. The seatbelt sign will be turned 
on in 10 minutes, at which time you will need to return to

This is Michael Danton calling from Harford Legal

attorney at my firm that your company is catering tonight. 
I just spoke to one of your employees who is setting up at 
the banquet hall we rented, and she mentioned that there 
will be sufficient food for 50 people. But over 75 guests 
will be attending this event. I’m not sure how this mistake 
happened . . . I was very clear when I met with you to 
organize the party, and the contract I signed states the 
number of attendees. I expect to see you here at the hall

Hello, Ms. Chen. It’s Damien Marks from Vox Wireless.  
I have some bad news . . . I won’t be able to repair your 
phone. I know I told you that it would be easy to replace 
the cracked screen. However, the problem is more 
serious than I thought. When you dropped your phone, 
you broke several internal components. This means that 
it’s going to cost more to fix your phone than to buy a 
new one. Why don’t you stop by the store to look at the 
models in stock? We’ll even give you a $100 store credit 
for your broken phone to use on your purchase. We’re 
open from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day, and I’m here from  
9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays if you have any questions.

Thank you for this opportunity to give a sales presentation 
on my company’s newest application. I think it’ll be 
perfect for your insurance firm. Um, Scheduler 2.0 is an 
integrated online platform that makes it easy to manage 
client appointments. A customer who visits your Web site 
will be prompted to select an appointment time, and the 
program will then automatically assign an agent. Uh, the 
employee will be able to access the client’s information to 
prepare for the meeting. For managers, this system can 
be used to see how many clients each team member is 
meeting and what products they have sold. OK . . . let me 
show you how it works. Then, I’ll answer any questions 
you might have.

I have a family emergency to deal with, and I won’t be

reschedule the interview? Also, I received an e-mail from 
Aiden Parker asking me for another example of my work. 
Um, I dropped it off at the reception desk on Wednesday. 
If he hasn’t received the sample yet, it should be waiting 
for him there. Of course, should my application be 
missing anything else, I’ll be happy to send it.

Good afternoon, Mr. Choi. This is Emily O’Neil from 
marketing. My manager asked that I contact the 
accounting department about buying a piece of furniture. 
We were just notified that someone from sales will be 
joining our team on October 13, and we need another 
chair. The model we would like to purchase is available 
at Dickson’s Office Supply for $45. I called the nearest 
branch, and the person I spoke to said it was in stock. 
She also mentioned that we could get a discount if we 
downloaded a coupon. I’ll e-mail you the requisition form 
in a few minutes. Please call me at extension 674 if you 
have any questions. Thank you.

호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  It’s time that we seriously consider adding more 
tables to our café. Our location has become quite 
popular this summer thanks to many new businesses 
opening in the area. And we’ve often had to turn 
away patrons.
W:  Yes, it’d definitely be better to have another seating 
area. But where should we set it up? I feel as though 
we’re already making good use of the space.
M:  How do you feel about getting rid of one of the 
display cases and arranging tables to the left of the 
entrance?
W:  That might work. Let’s try doing it tonight. I think there 
are extra tables in the basement that we can use.

W:  May I speak with Ludi Tan? I’m trying to contact him 
on behalf of Oakland Roofing about a voice mail he 
left for us an hour ago.
M:  This is he. Thanks for the quick response. As  
I mentioned in my message, a small spot on my roof 
was damaged during last Friday’s thunderstorm. One 
of your representatives came to my house yesterday. 
He said that the section near the chimney was in bad 
shape and would be costly to repair. However, he 
never e-mailed me a final quote like he said he 
would.
W:  I apologize about that, Mr. Tan. I’ll contact the person 
who visited your home, get the quote, and then call 
you back shortly.

W:  Good morning. This is Christy from the administrative 
team. Seeing as you began working in a new position 
last Wednesday, you should come to our office to 
replace your employee ID.
M:  OK. However, I can’t stop by tomorrow because I’m 
attending a convention in Baton Rouge. Would 
sometime next Monday be possible?
W:  I’m afraid not. You’re supposed to get a new ID 
before the end of the week according to company 
policy.
M:  Hmm . . . I might be able to visit your office later this 
afternoon. Could I come at 4 p.m.?
W:  That should work . . . I have a meeting at 3 p.m., but it 
shouldn’t last long. Why don’t you give me a call at 
around 3:30 p.m. to make sure I’m available?
Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   We didn’t order enough computers for the interns 
hired to work in the finance department. As of now, 
only 15 of them will be delivered next Monday.
M1:   Although we need 20 devices, we have five used 
ones in the storage closet that we can reformat.
M2:   Yeah. I thought we planned to use them, which is 
why I ordered as many as I did.
W:   Unfortunately, the finance director said that he 
wants all interns to get brand-new devices.
M2:   Oh, I didn’t realize that. I’ll call our supplier now and 
see if the existing order can be updated to include 
the extra machines.
W:   Thanks. And as we probably won’t need those used 
computers anymore, please remove their serial 
numbers from the list of available devices when you 
have a chance.
Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  There you are, Alice. An accident has apparently 
occurred in the waiting area for office visitors. 
Someone knocked over a vase, and pieces of glass 
are all over the floor. I’ve got to deal with a leaking 
pipe on the fourth floor, so can you clean up that 
mess? Just grab a broom and dustpan from our 
maintenance office.
W:  Actually, I’m on my way home. My shift ended 20 
minutes ago. Could you ask Ryan to do it instead?
M:  He’s helping set up for this afternoon’s press 
conference. The preparations are coming along 
slowly, so he probably can’t break away from that 
now. I’ll just take care of it myself.
Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

W:  Hi. I’d like to book one of the barbecue areas near 
the community center’s outdoor swimming pool.  
I want to use it for a party next Sunday.
M:  All right. You’ll need to fill this out and pay a $100 
security deposit.
W:  Umm . . . sorry, but can I ask what the deposit is for?
M:  We need it in case you damage any of the equipment. 
It should be given back to you following an inspection 
of the area after your party.
W:  That’s understandable. Oh, also . . . Do you provide 
charcoal for the grill?
M:  We don’t. There’s a convenience store one block 
down Harvest Street. It should have some for sale.

M:  Hello. I’m here to inquire about traveler’s insurance 
for college students.
W:  I’m sorry. Our location doesn’t offer insurance plans 
for students. Ah . . . did you mean to visit our branch 
near Northside Park? It’s closer to Gregtown 
University, so they offer plans for students.
M:  I just got the address for your travel agency from a 
flyer. I found it at a local study abroad fair I attended 
recently. So, I wasn’t aware you have multiple 
locations. Anyway, if you could give me the other 
branch’s address, I’d appreciate it.
W:  Certainly. I’ll write it down for you. Um, that branch is 
about a mile away, so you might want to get a taxi.

W:  I connected with a factory in India that can 
manufacture our copiers affordably. The plant’s owner 
has a strong relationship with a shipping company. He 
said he could get us a cost-effective rate to transport 
our goods to the United States.
M:  Excellent. And did you explain that I’d want to come 
to India to inspect the facility in person prior to 
making a decision? I’ll need to evaluate its quality 
control process as I’ve done for our partners in 
Mexico and Thailand in the past.
W:  I spoke with him about that via videoconference 
yesterday, and it won’t be an issue. He said you’re 
welcome to travel there at your convenience.
M:  OK. I’ll have my assistant coordinate with him about 
dates.

W:  Good afternoon. I just opened an office for my 
accounting firm at 209 Randall Drive in Kingfield. And 
I need my business’s garbage and recycling to be 
picked up weekly. I’m contacting your trash collection 
company because it’s very well reviewed on blogs.
M:  Thank you for your interest in TriStar Collection. Due 
to city zoning laws, however, we are prohibited from 
operating in the Kingfield neighborhood. My 
apologies for the inconvenience. I recommend that 
you get in touch with Henderson Garbage, as they 
are contracted to serve Kingfield.
W:  I recall reading positive comments about that 
business too, so I’ll definitely contact them right 
away.

M1:   Cathy, do you have any more questions for  
Mr. Williams before we conclude his interview?
W:   Just one. While you provided your résumé and cover 
letter, I didn’t notice a letter of recommendation. Do 
you have one?
M2:   Oh, yes. I thought I attached it to the other 
documents, but let me check my briefcase. Ah . . . 
here it is.
W:   I appreciate it. I think that will do it for me, Chris.
M1:   In that case, we’re done here, Mr. Williams. We’ll 
send you the interview results by e-mail no later 
than next Wednesday. I can walk you back to the 
main lobby now.
M2:   Wonderful. Thanks for your assistance, and I look 
forward to hearing back from you.

W:  Do you have a list of the computer codes associated 
with each color used in last month’s flyer?
M:  They all appear on our intranet page after you click 
on Designs, so you can find them there. Are you 
working on a new membership advertisement?
W:  Yes. Our airline’s focus for the previous promotion 
was to attract more Basic Level members. But now, 
we want to promote the paid memberships, which 
provide better benefits to customers. Among those 
paid membership levels, we’re specifically trying to 
improve the less popular of the two.
M:  I see. By the way, I developed a marketing research 
report on our competitors’ paid membership programs. 
I can e-mail you a copy of that, if you think it will be 
useful.

M:  Thanks for showing me this laundry room. The fact 
that it’s so modern is one more great feature of the 
apartment building.
W:  I’m glad you like it. I should also point out that the 
gym is just one floor above us now.
M:  Oh, could we take a look at it?
W:  I’m sorry, but it’s closed today because some new 
workout machines are being set up.
M:  Then what about the recreation room? I’m rather 
curious about that too.
W:  I can take you there. But first, I need to run to my 
office quickly. My colleague just texted me saying 
he’s having trouble printing out the application form 
for you to review.
M:  No problem. I’ll wait here until you return.

M:  Anika, I just received a memo from Donald Powell . . . 
uh . . . the head of maintenance. He said the parking 
areas in our industrial complex will be repainted.
W:  OK. When will the work begin?
M:  Well, each parking area will be closed for one day 
next month. The research laboratory lot will be first, 
and then the factory lot will be painted on May 5. The 
next day, the workers will paint the administration 
office lot, and they’ll finish up with the warehouse lot 
on May 7. Signs will be posted in the respective 
buildings for each lot on the days when the work will 
be carried out.
W:  Where can staff park on those days?
M:  Temporary passes for a nearby parking garage will 
be issued. I’ll hand them out on May 1.

Everyone, I have an announcement to make. Up until 
now, our yoga studio hasn’t had a dress code. You’ve 
been able to wear whatever you like in the workplace. 
But starting next month, you’ll be required to wear a 
uniform. It’s a security issue . . . Some parts of the studio 
are off-limits to customers, and this policy change will 
make it easier to notice anyone who shouldn’t be in these 
areas. I know everyone enjoys dressing casually at work, 
but you don’t have anything to worry about. The uniform 
is simply a white polo shirt with the company logo on it. I’ll 
order these shirts from the supplier tomorrow, so please 
put your size on this chart. Thanks.

I’d like to go over a few basic payroll procedures with you 
all while I have your attention. To begin with, please 
make sure that you fill out your time sheets and send 
them to the accounting department every day. The 
departmental e-mail address is included on Page 12 of 
your employee handbook. Staff members should also try 
to submit daily reports prior to the end of their shifts. It’s 
OK if they’re received by the next day on occasion, but 
turning them in any later will be reflected in your annual 
evaluations. Also, be reminded that supervisors must 
formally agree to all overtime work in order for employees 
to qualify for time and a half. Anyone who works overtime 
without the required approval will be paid their usual 
hourly wage.

Attention all visitors to the Greenford Botanical Gardens. 
It is now 10 p.m., and the facility will be closing in 30 
minutes. The gift shop will cease operations ten minutes 
prior to this, at 10:20. We encourage everyone to begin 
exiting the grounds now. Please take your belongings, 
including those stored in the lockers located near the 
visitors’ center, with you when leaving. As a reminder, the 
South Gate has been temporarily blocked off for 
renovations. Therefore, direct access to Parking Lot A is 
only available through the East Gate. I would also like to 
take this opportunity to invite you to come back next 
month. To celebrate our fifth anniversary, we will be 
hosting a special exhibition of roses and tulips from May

OK . . . I was just informed that we’ll be participating in

clients to the distinctive promotional campaigns we 
create. Derek, I’d like you to contact the convention 
center to book a booth with the necessary audio-visual 
equipment. You can use the company credit card to pay 
the deposit. We’ll also require brochures to hand out at 
the convention. Document Express printed the materials

I’d like to let you know about the company’s latest 
wellness initiative. Studies have shown that stretching on 
a regular basis can improve a person’s health. So, 
beginning on Monday, all employees who are logged in to 
the company’s Intranet system will receive a pop-up 
message twice a day. If you click it, a five-minute 
instructional video of various stretching exercises will 
play. Just follow along in your workspace. It’s not 
mandatory but, um . . . why not give it a try? You’ll 
probably feel a lot better. I also wanted to mention that the 
fitness center in the building is holding a special promotion 
tomorrow. If you show your employee ID, you will receive 
a 15 percent discount on a membership. You should take 
advantage of this offer.

Good afternoon. This is Jia Chen calling from Denver 
Flooring. I’d like to respond to the phone inquiry you made 
yesterday, when our business was closed . . . um, about 
our prices. We generally charge $30 per hour for 
installation. Additionally, the flooring cost per square 
meter varies depending on the type of material you 
choose. Based on the flooring type you mentioned in your 
message, the amount we’d charge you per square meter 
is $35. If you find this to be too expensive, please consider 
some of the other flooring options—our most popular one 
is $20 per square meter. You can find details about these 
materials at www.denfloor.com. If you would like to 
schedule a consultation, you can reach me at 555-4988.

Attention, front desk staff. Tomorrow, the remodeled 
Presswood Hotel will be opened to the public. Here are a 
few things to keep in mind . . . First, when guests check 
in, make sure they know that our room service hours 
have been extended. Um, they can place orders until 
midnight now. Also, there is a problem with the 
housekeeping office’s extension. For the time being, 
guests should just contact the front desk if they need 
things like towels or pillows. Finally, we will be offering a 
complimentary continental breakfast this week. It will be 
served in the main dining room until 10 a.m. every day. 
OK. That’s all.
