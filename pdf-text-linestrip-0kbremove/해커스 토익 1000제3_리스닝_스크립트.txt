PART 3
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
W:  The layout of the facility is much more open than 
the health club I used to exercise at. Plus, I’m 
impressed with how modern the workout 
equipment is here and that there’s an indoor pool. 
M:  I’m glad you like it. I actually started my 
membership here last month and received four 
free sessions with a certified personal trainer just 
for signing up. You can take advantage of the 
offer as well if you register before August.
W:  Yes, I think I will. I commute past the building, so it 
would be easy for me to stop by after work.
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	
M:  Did you go to the new employee orientation 
yesterday? I don’t remember seeing you there, but 
I thought you were planning to help facilitate it.
W:  Unfortunately, I had to leave the orientation early 
because the new head of sales wanted to get 
together with me. Our discussion lasted longer 
than expected, so I wasn’t able to return before it 
ended. I hope my absence didn’t cause any 
issues. 
M:  Oh, no. I was only curious. The event fortunately 
went smoothly, so we didn’t need any additional

assistance. And all the telemarketing staff who 
attended showed a lot of promise. 
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  Hi. I was told that Mount Everest Sunset, the 
documentary film that I came to watch, is being 
screened in Room 220. But nobody was there 
when I arrived. 
M:  You must have been given outdated information. 
Due to problems with the projector, the screening 
had to be moved to a different room. However, the 
film started five minutes ago, and there’s no more 
available seating. I’m very sorry. 
W:  That’s too bad. Well, will the film be shown again 
sometime soon? 
M:  There will be another showing at 6:45 p.m. in 
Room 243. Should you decide to return for it, I 
suggest coming at 6:30 to secure a place to sit.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	
M:  When I came to the shop this morning, there was 
no power in the building. None of the lights 
worked, and our security system was deactivated. 
W:  Oh, really? That sounds very odd. The power is 
back on now, however. So, did the issue correct 
itself, or did you have to address it somehow? 
M:  I contacted the utility provider’s emergency hotline 
and told a representative about the situation. 
Then, a company technician was sent out to 
conduct a check. Apparently, the circuit breaker 
had been disconnected. He set it again before 
leaving and said it shouldn’t be a recurring 
problem. 
W:  I’m glad he was able to resolve the matter fairly 
easily.
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
W:  Derrick, I’ve been meaning to talk to you all 
morning. I realize you’ve been busy of late, but I 
think we should try to arrange a time to rehearse 
for next Tuesday’s presentation to the board 
members. As you know, they’re going to expect a 
full report on our corporate assets and recent 
performance on the stock market. 
M:  If you have some free time on Wednesday, maybe 
we can meet then. Right now, that afternoon is 
open for me, whereas the rest of my week is 
booked through Friday.
W:  OK, let’s set up an appointment for that day at 
1:30 p.m. We can meet in the main conference 
room. Also, I’ll bring the financial reports that we 
intend to share with the board so we can review 
them as well.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음	
M:  All right, Ms. O’Donnell. Let me confirm your order 
one last time before processing it. You would like 
an XR Pro laptop with a high-definition monitor, 
upgraded internal speakers, and DuraFX graphics 
card. Is that correct?
W:  Yes, everything sounds accurate. By the way, I 
read in an advertisement that your company is 
giving away a portable memory card with every 
computer purchase. Does that mean one will be 
sent with the laptop?
M:  Although we were running that promotion for a 
while, it hasn’t been valid for over two weeks now. 
Do you still want to follow through with the 
purchase without it? 
W:  Oh, yes. I can always buy a memory card 
separately if need be. Now, please wait a moment 
while I find my credit card so that we can finalize 
the transaction.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  I just heard from the owner of Kitchen Boutique in 
Boston, Mr. Pinker. It seems that some of the 
dishes we sent to the store were cracked along 
the way. However, the merchandise that he 
purchased is no longer in production, and what we 
sent him was the last of our stock. So, he wants a 
refund.
M:  We can of course provide Mr. Pinker with a 
refund, but try to convince him to exchange the 
items for other ones of equal value. That would be 
more profitable for us.
W:  I did, but he wasn’t interested. Should I just give 
him a complete refund?
M:  First, offer him five percent off any exchange that 
he makes. Even after the discount, we’ll likely still 
benefit from the sale.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
W:  I checked your feature story on the city’s soccer 
stadium development project. You did a great job 
on it, but I think it would be a good idea to include 
a quote from Terry Guild, the project director. 
Inc luding a statement  f rom a top- level 
administrator on how construction of the venue is 
progressing would lend more authority to the 
piece. 
M:  I tried contacting him, but his assistant said he’s 
on a business trip and won’t return until next 
Monday. 
W:  Hmm. Why don’t you call his assistant and ask for 
Mr. Guild’s e-mail address? Perhaps he’d be 
willing to send you a written statement to use 
before we print the newspaper’s weekend edition.

M:  I’ll take care of that right away. 
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Hello, Ms. Mari. I want to congratulate you on 
giving an excellent talk today. Your insight into the 
impact of economics on the political process is 
fascinating, and I’m curious whether you’re going 
to study the topic in more depth in the near future.
W:  Thank you for the kind words. And, yes, I hope to 
look into the matter further. However, I failed to 
secure a fellowship this fall, so I’m not sure if I’ll 
be able to afford to do so. 
M:  You know, I have a friend named Richard Werner 
who teaches social science at the University of 
Hamline. He just recently applied for a variety of 
independent grants to support his scholarship. I 
should put you in touch with him, as he may have 
some suggestions about alternative grant options.
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  Hello. Pittsburgh Financial Group. This is Jenny 
speaking. How can I help you?
M:  I recently inherited a sum from a relative, and I’m 
now looking for a way to invest it that will provide 
healthy returns yet is relatively low risk. What 
types of investment strategies does your firm offer 
that meet those needs?
W:  Our company’s investment strategies are 
personalized to each individual, which means that 
you’l l have to talk directly to one of our 
professional financial planners to discuss an ideal 
investment approach. Would you like me to set up 
an appointment for you to do that?
M:  I’m currently out of town, so I’d like to hold off on 
that until I return home and have a clearer idea of 
my schedule. In the meantime, could you e-mail 
me an informational pamphlet about your financial 
products? I think I’d find that very useful. 
PART 4
Questions 71-73 refer to the following instructions.
미국식	발음	
We’ve installed new washing machines at our laundry 
facility that consume less water. Just so you all know, 
the appliances need to be operated a bit differently 
than our previous ones. First, rather than loading 
detergent into the top of the washers, it needs to be 
poured into slots on the sides of the devices. Second, 
the machines are designed to automatically turn off 
when they’ve been overloaded. If this occurs, please 
remove some of the clothing and restart the cycle. All 
the washers have the same control panel as our old 
appliances, so everyone should be familiar with its 
layout. But feel free to come to me if you experience 
any complications while using them.
Questions 74-76 refer to the following telephone message.
호주식	발음
This is Chuck Greenwald calling from Peter’s Moving 
Company.  There  seems to  have been a 
miscommunication regarding when your belongings 
are supposed to be dropped off at 415 Moody Road. 
My crew and I got here at 4 o’clock as is written on 
your invoice. However, the front door is locked, and 
you haven’t answered any of my calls. We’ve been 
waiting for 30 minutes but can’t stay any longer, as 
we have another job to take care of across town. So, 
you’ll have to contact our main office to reschedule 
the delivery for a later date. If the error is our fault, I 
apologize for the inconvenience. 
Questions 77-79 refer to the following announcement.
영국식	발음
Attention, everyone. Filming of our commercial has to 
be delayed. Our director is running behind schedule 
due to a press conference that ended a half hour later 
than anticipated. Although the director is currently on 
her way to the recording studio, she won’t get here for 
at least another 20 minutes. While we wait for her to 
arrive, I encourage the actors to use this extra time to 
rehearse their lines with one another. You may do so 
in the seating area near the front door. As for the 
technical crew, please examine all of the cameras, 
lights, and props to make sure everything has been 
properly set up. I’ll update you on the director’s status 
again in about 15 minutes. I appreciate your 
understanding. 
Questions 80-82 refer to the following traffic report.
미국식	발음
Now it’s time for Radio KPR’s morning traffic update. 
Due to an accident that took place 30 minutes ago, 
Flint Bridge has been blocked off to vehicles and 
pedestrians. Although nobody was injured in the 
incident, four cars were involved in it, all of which 
need to be towed from the scene so that the bridge 
will once again be accessible. According to officials, 
the situation should be dealt within the next hour, yet 
there’s a chance that more time may be needed 
before traffic in the area returns to normal. For now, 
commuters are encouraged to cross the Delaware 
River by using East Bridge, which remains unaffected 
by congestion.

호주식	발음
Good morning, Ms. Vine. This is Harrison Wills from 
the legal department, and I’m responding to your 
voice mail regarding Mr. Pindar’s contract. I want to 
confirm that it contains a minor error. As you noted, it 
indicates that Mr. Pindar’s start date at our firm is July 
6. Yet he will not begin work as the regional director 
until July 16. My assistant plans to amend the mistake 
by this afternoon. After she has done so, she will 
e-mail the revised copy to you. Once the contract is in 
your possession, I encourage you to read it over one 
final time before forwarding it to Mr. Pindar to sign. If 
you discover any other issues, please don’t hesitate 
to tell me. 
Questions 86-88 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting. 
미국식	발음
Beginning in September, our writing staff will have the 
option of telecommuting up to half of the workweek. 
Management feels that the added flexibility will 
increase productivity while also saving employees 
transportation costs. If you’d like to try telecommuting, 
you’ll need to first get approval. To do so, create an 
outline of the hours that you’ll work from home and 
give it to me before the end of the week. Just keep in 
mind that you’ll have to log in for at least four hours 
while our office is open when telecommuting. Beyond 
that, you’ll be free to log in at your convenience so

Questions 89-91 refer to the following talk.
호주식	발음
We’ve convened here today to discuss the future of 
the Kilmore Wildlife Sanctuary. As members of the 
board of trustees, we need to determine how the 
facility is going to adapt to a shrinking annual budget. 
As you all know, we will not be receiving funding from 
The Earth Foundation as of next January. The loss of 
that money will represent a 20 percent drop in 
revenue for us. This is a major setback, and it is going 
to force us to minimize our spending. In my opinion, 
our best approach would be to hold off on all 
expansion projects until the funding source has been 
replaced. If any of you have alternative ideas, I’m very 
interested in hearing them, so please take the next 
few minutes to share your thoughts with the group. 
Questions 92-94 refer to the following news report.
영국식	발음
This is Kathy Long with BBS News. Our top business 
story today covers the long-awaited release of 
JarinSport’s new fitness device, the HealthPlus. The 
HealthPlus is designed to keep track of health-based 
statistics, including the wearer’s heart rate, blood 
pressure, and number of calories burned while 
working out. Consumers who participated in the trial 
run reviewed the first version of the device very 
posit ively and noted i ts impressive overal l 
functionality. While some shoppers will be able to 
purchase the HealthPlus early this May, initial 
supplies are not expected to last long. Advance 
orders for the item have far surpassed JarinSport’s 
expectations, so the company expects its stock to sell 
out at stores very quickly. As a result of this high 
demand for the device, many consumers will probably 
be forced to wait to buy the HealthPlus until another 
batch is made available in June. 
Questions 95-97 refer to the following introduction. 
미국식	발음
It’s my pleasure to introduce Sandra Hedges. As most 
of  you probably know, Ms. Hedges is  an 
internationally acclaimed musician and conductor who 
released a classical piano album this spring. She has 
been invited here to conduct our orchestra for a 
special series of concerts. In preparation for the 
series, which will include four separate shows, you 
will all rehearse with her over the course of the next 
five days. Rehearsals will last from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 
p.m. Moreover, Ms. Hedges has offered to arrive at 
7:30 each day to put in extra time with anyone 
interested. While this is optional, I strongly suggest 
taking advantage of the opportunity. Now, Ms. 
Hedges would like to say a few words. 
Questions 98-100 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.
미국식	발음
Our primary goal for today is to dig a 100-foot hole for 
city water pipes to be laid in. In order to do this, 
however, we’ll need to clear away any tools and 
supplies that are currently stacked in the area to 
make room for large construction vehicles, including a 
bulldozer and a backhoe. They’re going to be brought 
to our construction site in just a few hours, so I’d like 
you all to start cleaning things up now. You can begin 
by moving the pipes and other materials to that 
section of grass over there. Then, load any gear that’s 
lying around into one of our trailers. Also, be careful 
when picking up the steel pipes. They’re very heavy, 
and I don’t want anyone to hurt their backs.

M:  Excuse me. My name is Charles Johnson. I can’t 
find my billfold, and I think I left it at your store 
after making a purchase a couple of hours ago. 
Has it been recovered by any chance?
W:  Actually, a shopper did turn one in a while ago. It 
had been discovered near a register in the 
menswear department. Let me just confirm that it 
is yours. Ah, yes. Here’s your driver’s license in 
the front slot.
M:  Oh, I’m so relieved! I’m only staying here in 
Montreal for the night and was worried that I 
wouldn’t recover it before heading to Toronto 
tomorrow. Thank you very much for holding on to 
it until I returned.

haven’t heard from him.
M:  I just received a message from his secretary 
indicating that his flight was delayed in Detroit. 
Apparently, a severe blizzard postponed his 
departure by an hour. His flight should arrive 
shortly, however. 
W:  Oh, I see. In that case, we’ll have to hold off 
starting the presentation on product development 
until this afternoon, as Mr. Herman is flying in to 
listen to it.

W:  Hello, this is Wendy Rahn from Perfect Pitch 
Design. I’m calling about some of the air 
conditioning units in our office building. Three of 
them are extremely loud and have been 
distracting to a number of employees. Could you 
please send technicians to take a look at them 
tomorrow?
M:  I’m sorry, but all our technicians are booked 
through Thursday. With the hot weather, we’ve 
been repairing a lot of machines of late. However, 
two of our workers are available this Friday. 
Would it be OK for them to stop by on that day 
instead?
W:  Actually, that would work well. We’re holding a 
picnic for staff that day, so there won’t be anyone 
here to get in your way. The building manager can 
give the workers access to our offices.

W1:  An employee f rom the Depar tment  o f

$75,000. 
W2:  Wonderful! Now we can finally afford to replace 
the outdated electronics in our computer lab with 
more modern equipment. People in the 
community are going to be very pleased with the 
news. 
W1:  That’s right. However, I guess the grant includes 
limitations on how the money can be spent. So, 
we’ll have to read over the documents carefully 
before buying computers or making any plans.

M:  Good morning. I work at Sandusky Industries, and 
we want to convert a vacant lot on our property 
into a garden with a seating area. Could your 
landscaping company handle a job of that scale?
W:  Absolutely. Although our firm does mostly 
residential work, we have commercial clients too. 
In fact, just last summer we did a large 
landscaping project for the Seward Grocery Store, 
which is located just three blocks from your facility. 
M:  Oh, really? I pass by that building daily, and I’m 
always impressed with how nice the property 
looks.

why don’t you tell me more about the work you’d

you earlier this week to get a quotation on a 
selection of floral arrangements that I want to use 
to decorate a function hall. I’ve decided to source 
the flowers from you.
M:  Thank you for choosing my shop, Ms. Grabble. If I 
remember correctly, you showed interest in two 
large decorative arrangements with tulips and 
geraniums. Would you still like me to prepare 
those arrangements for you?
W:  Actually, I found out that one of my staff members 
is allergic to geraniums, so I’d rather not 
incorporate them. 
M:  Why don’t we pair the tulips with lilies instead? 
That will also make for a beautiful combination.

can be seen from the bedroom. Rent is $1,900  a 
month. If you’re interested in submitting an 
application, I can take it now.
W:  The apartment is very impressive, especially the 
incredible views. But I have another showing 
tomorrow, which I’d like to follow through with 
before making a decision on where to live. 
M:  Of course. Just be aware that another potential 
renter saw the unit this morning. Although she has 
yet to submit an application, she assured me that 
she was going to soon. Whoever turns one in first 
will be given priority.

M:  While examining our crops, I noticed that the 
lettuce and corn don’t look good. Their soil is drier 
than usual, and many of their leaves are a bit pale 
in color. I think the fields need to be watered more 
frequently. 
W:  Although we’re experiencing an especially long 
drought, the crops should be able to handle the 
conditions. I think the real issue is insects, as I 
discovered small flies feeding on the plants. 
M:  If that’s the cause of the problem, then I’m not 
sure how we can address it. Our vegetables are 
organic, so we can’t use chemicals on them to kill 
the insects. 
W:  Actually, there is a new liquid pesticide available

W:  To commemorate Earth Day, I’d like to encourage 
employees to devote some of their personal time

think of what we could do. Can you think of 
anything?
M:  Why don’t we clean garbage from the side of a 
nearby freeway? The last business I worked for 
hosted a similar event every year. There was 
always a high turnout among workers, and 
everyone could see the impact of their efforts at 
the end of the day. 
W:  I really like that suggestion. It would also be great 
if we could get some publicity from the event to 
further improve our company’s image. 
M:  I’ll notify a local broadcast television network 
before I get off work today about our plans and 
find out whether it would be willing to cover the 
event in a special segment.

M:  How are negotiations going with TruCare Medical 
Supplies? Did the president of TruCare say 
whether the company agrees to our buyout terms 
regarding the retention of personnel?
W:  He mentioned that, fortunately, none of our 
existing employees will be dismissed if TruCare 
acquires our firm. However, all staff would be 
subject to a six-month evaluation following the 
buyout to determine whether they should be 
offered extended contracts. 
M:  Hmm. Well, at least everyone will be able to 
maintain their jobs. Have financial figures been 
discussed at all?
W:  As of now, we’re being offered 45 dollars per 
share, which our analysts tell me is about  
7 percent lower than market value. With your 
approval, I’ll suggest that the company pay  
48 dollars per share.

transportation, accommodation, and food expenses 
up to $300 per day were covered for all work-related

My name is Victor Anderson, and I’m calling to learn a 
bit more about your carpet cleaning services. My 
home in Hampshire has a carpeted living room that 
measures about six by four meters in size. It tends to 
collect a lot of animal hair from my dogs, so I’m 
considering arranging recurring cleanings on a 
monthly basis. At this point, I’d like to receive a quote 
from your company so I can see the differences 
between your estimates and those from some 
competitors in the area. I can be reached on my 
house phone at 555-2930 any time between  
5 p.m. and 8 p.m. either today or tomorrow. I look 
forward to hearing from you.

is here representing Sustained Agriculture, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to providing cheap, effective 
farming equipment to developing countries. She is 
going to begin by showing some slides documenting

The William Bunker School of Law will be holding a 
job fair on Saturday, May 14, for its students. The 
event will be an excellent way for a small private legal 
practice like ours to reach out to potential future 
employees. That’s why I’d like to have at least two 
staff members operate a booth at the event. 
Informational pamphlets have already been designed 
and printed. So, those who volunteer would only be 
responsible for attending the event, answering 
attendees’ questions, and passing out promotional 
materials. If this sounds like something you’d be 
willing to do, please let me know by the end of the 
week so that I can make the necessary arrangements.

Hello, and thanks for attending this one-day seminar 
on import and export regulations here in the United 
Kingdom. My name is Natalie Sanchez, and I will be 
your instructor. As is indicated on the programs that 
everyone received, the seminar is going to be broken 
down into three main sections. During the first part of 
the meeting, I am going to provide a lecture, in which 
I will discuss the most recent changes to the country’s 
import and export laws. Following that, we will focus 
on a handful of well-known case studies that highlight 
breaches of those regulations. Finally, we will 
conclude by holding an open forum. At that point, you 
all will be given an opportunity to pose questions 
related to your specific industries.

W:  What do you think about the conveyor belt that 
was installed here in our factory a couple of weeks 
ago? Do you feel as though it’s having a positive 
impact on productivity?
M:  Absolutely. It’s much faster than the previous one. 
Although it hasn’t been operational for very long, 
I’ve already noticed an uptick in our production 
levels. I’d guess that we’re packaging at least 5 
percent more cases of fruit per day. 
W:  Wow! That’s a significant change for such a short 
period of time. We should share that information 
with our regional director when we see her on 
Thursday. She’ll be very pleased to hear about 
our improved efficiency.

Do you have any applications for the position

Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  A shipment will be arriving here this afternoon. A 
gallery in Paris is sending us multiple crates 
containing statues that we have on loan. When 
the shipment arrives, everything must be 
unpacked and moved to our main exhibition hall. 
I’d like you to oversee the task.
M:  OK. However, do you know how many containers 
are coming? I’m curious about the number of 
people who will be needed for the job. Usually, 
Jeff and I unpack shipments, but it sounds like this 
one may require additional staff. 
W:  There will be 25 crates, so I don’t think you two 
can manage it on your own. 
M:  I see. I’ll have our interns give us a hand then.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Excuse me. I’m on vacation here in Boston, and 
I’m not very familiar with the city. Is the Benton 
Theater near this intersection?
M:  It would probably take you 40 minutes to get there 
on foot. So, while you could walk there, the 
subway would be much faster. You could take the 
Silver Line south and get off at Roxbury Crossing. 
That’s the nearest stop to your destination. 
W:  Yes, I think I’ll do that. Also, what’s the fare to take 
the subway? 
M:  A one-way ticket is $1.25. But if you plan on taking 
at least a few rides today, you should purchase a 
daily pass at the subway station. They’re just 
$3.50 and can be used for limitless rides 
throughout the day.

M:  Good morning, and thank you for calling Polaris 
Resort. This is Thomas speaking. How can I help 
you?
W:  My name is Angela Hatton, and I booked a suite 
at your hotel from today until Monday, December 
3, as I’m going to the accounting seminar that is 
taking place in your function hall this weekend. 
Unfortunately, my plane is unable to take off due 
to a lightning storm, and I won’t be able to leave 
for Sydney until tomorrow.
M:  I can certainly cancel your reservation for today, 
Ms. Hatton. Just be aware that we will have to 
charge you 10 percent of the room price for not 
providing at least two days’ notice for the change. 
W:  I understand, and that’s fine. You can charge the 
amount to my bill.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  This is Brian Chase from Pasley Incorporated. I’ve 
selected some items from your supply catalog that 
I’d like to order for my company. Specifically, I’m 
interested in a 24-pack of black ballpoint pens, 6 
reams of paper, and two orders of the 100-pack of 
folders.
W:  While we sell the pens and paper in those 
quantities, we unfortunately no longer carry 
folders in sets of 100. However, you can purchase 
four sets of the same folders in packs of 50. 
Ultimately, that combination of folder sets costs 
about five dollars more than what we used to 
charge for a pair of 100-pack ones.
M:  That’s fine with me, since the price is so similar. 
Please go ahead and process the order.
W:  Excellent. I’ll charge the amount to the credit card 
number your company has on record with us.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.

W:  I just looked over a hard copy of our annual report 
and noticed a major mistake. On the second page, 
it indicates that our firm’s market share increased 
by 24 percent this year, when in actuality it grew 
by 2.4 percent. 
M:  Thank you for pointing the matter out to me.  
I must have forgotten to include a decimal point 
while I was writing the statistic. Since we haven’t 
printed the final copies yet, there’s still time to fix 
the problem before mailing the document out to 
investors.
W:  Yes, but please thoroughly proofread it again to 
search for other typos. It’s essential that it be 
completely without error.
M:  Of course, and I’m sorry about the mistake.

M:  The food tasting with the Finleys seemed to go 
quite well. Although Ms. Finley didn’t care for one 
of the appetizers, the couple praised the roasted 
duck and our homemade salad dressing. 
W:  They also really appreciated that our company 
sources vegetables and meat from farmers in the 
area. Considering the positive feedback we 
received, I think there’s a good chance that they’ll 
hire us to prepare dinner for their wedding 
reception. 
M:  I certainly hope so. Over 300 guests will be at the 
reception, so it would offer an excellent

the results. I took the bicycle for a ride yesterday, 
and it’s operating worse now than before I brought 
it here.
M:  I’m sure I can correct the situation. But first,  
I need to know what work was done to the bike as 
well as what the matter is with it now.
W:  Your employee inspected the gearshift and 
braking system and said they were in need of 
replacement. I paid $200 for the repairs, and now I 
can’t shift out of fourth gear. I’d like a full refund 
for the work. 
M:  Our shop doesn’t offer refunds on maintenance 
work. However, I would be happy to look the bike 
over and fix it at no extra cost.

M:  My name is Erik Danson, and I’m calling in regard 
to your business’s home exterior painting 
services. I saw your advertisement in today’s 
newspaper for free estimates and would like to 
schedule one. The sidings on both my house and 
garage are quite faded from the sun. 
W:  Someone can look at the structures and provide a 
figure by as soon as tomorrow morning if that’s 
suitable for you. All I need now is your address, 
and our worker will discuss any further relevant 
information with you following the visit. 
M:  The address is 304 Beechwood Lane. And I’ll be 
home all morning, so that’s actually very 
convenient. Should I expect someone around a 
certain time?
W:  A worker should arrive between 8:30 a.m. and 
10:30 a.m. If they cannot get there by then, they’ll 
call you to let you know.

For the next part of your training, I’m going to explain 
our supermarket’s method for restocking groceries. 
First, start by taking any spoiling fruit and vegetables 
off the display racks. It’s fine if items have been on 
the racks for a couple of days so long as they’re still 
fresh. Next, fill up the display with new produce from 
the cardboard boxes and make sure that everything is 
stacked in an orderly way. Finally, you can flatten any 
empty boxes and pile them beside the garage door in 
the loading bay. OK, now I want to discuss how to 
conduct inventory.

This is a Deutschland Transport announcement for all 
passengers heading from Hannover to Dresden. We 
regret to inform you that due to a complication with 
the track signals, the high-speed train to Dresden will 
not be leaving on schedule. It is expected to take up 
to one hour to solve this problem. Once the signals 
are operational again, we will give travelers a 
10-minute window to board. We encourage 
passengers to stay on Platform 5 in the meantime. 
However, those who are in a rush can exchange their 
tickets for passes to a slower train that is departing in 
the next 15 minutes and will most likely reach the 
destination sooner than the original one.

Since our company accepted federal subsidies this 
year, the Bureau of Revenue is going to conduct an 
audit of our business. The audit will involve the 
inspection of our financial transactions over the 
previous 12 months. In order to ensure that this 
process goes smoothly, I’m going to assemble a 
small team of people from our accounting department 
to be in charge of collaborating with government 
agents. This team will be responsible for collecting 
and sharing any financial records that are requested. 
Members should also regularly update me on how the 
audit is coming along. I’ll announce who is going to be 
selected for the project by the end of the workday.

You’re listening to Urban Activities, a weekly podcast 
devoted to discussing the latest trends in urban living 
here in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I’m your host, Ned 
Greenly. The focus of today’s episode is the growth of 
community gardens. Over the course of the show, I’ll 
describe the impact that such gardens are having on 
Minneapolis as well as identify the areas within the 
city where they are thriving today. I’ll also be joined by 
Sarah Emmer, a graduate student from Minnesota 
University. Ms. Emmer will talk about the campaign 
she’s leading to convince local school district 
administrators to build community gardens on the 
land owned by public high schools. She feels that 
tending these plots of land is an effective way for 
youth to connect with each other, residents from the 
area, and nature.

In local news, the Lawson Center for Science and 
Discovery will be hosting two-day summer workshops 
every weekend from June 3 through August 4. The 
workshops will be for teenagers aged 13 to 15 who 
have a passion for science. Teens will be taught 
some of the fundamental principles of biology, 
geology, chemistry, and physics through a variety of 
interactive exercises and lectures. Participants will 
then be expected to put what they learned to practical 
use by carrying out experiments. Organizers are also 
inviting adults with a background in science to 
volunteer for the events. If this is something you 
would like to do, you can register in person at the 
Lawson Center.

Thank you all for coming to take part in our morning 
horseback ride here at Rolling Meadows Ranch. For 
the trip, we’ll be taking Point Trail along a river for 
roughly four miles and then heading through Stoop 
Valley. You were all reminded in an e-mail I sent out 
to bring water, sunscreen, and some type of 
headgear to protect yourselves from overexposure to 
the sun, so I hope everyone has come properly 
equipped. And in case you’re worried, we’ll also be 
supplying everyone with a pair of durable riding 
gloves to wear. OK, now I want to lead everyone to 
the stable, where I’m going to match each of you with 
an appropriately-sized horse. So, follow me this way.

I need to make a brief announcement to all staff. 
Please remember to wash your hands with 
antibacterial soap over the course of the day. Since 
you all handle food and regularly work directly with 
kids who have colds, it is crucial that we take the 
necessary measures to prevent the spread of germs 
at our day care center. This is especially important 
right now because many kids become ill during the 
fall and winter seasons. As a reminder, there are 
areas set up in every room of the building for your 
convenience that have bottles filled with sanitizer and 
towels to wipe off your hands with.
Questions 98-100 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.
호주식	발음
Our talent agency is implementing a new recruitment 
process that will encourage employees to recommend 
candidates to our human resources department. 
Specifically, workers will be eligible for a bonus if our 
agency hires someone who they have suggested and 
if that person is retained following a probationary 
period. The bonus used to incentivize workers will 
amount to $500, which will be paid out as part of the 
recipient’s next due paycheck. Management feels that 
the new policy will help us to further strengthen our 
company by encouraging us to find more qualified 
applicants. A formal memo about the policy will be 
distributed by the end of the week, and it should 
address any question you may have.

members. We still have tickets available for other

M:  Diane, it’s Otto. I’m calling to see if you could pick 
me up from the train station at 12 p.m. today

had to wait for another one.
W:  If you were scheduled to arrive in the morning, I’d 
be able to pick you up. But 12 p.m. is too late for 
me. The director has already asked me to take 
some investors who are in town from Taiwan out 
to a luncheon. I probably won’t finish with that until 
2 o’clock.
M:  That’s OK. I’ll just take a taxi to the office. Since 
I’m returning from a business trip, I should be able

W:  Since the article focuses on your architectural 
work, perhaps we could meet at the construction 
site of the latest building you designed, the Grand 
Theater. I could photograph you in front of the 
partially finished structure. 
M:  That sounds good. By the way, once the building

appreciate it if you’d be willing to help me move 
my things with your van. 
M:  Oh, I sold that vehicle not too long ago. I wasn’t 
using it very often, and I needed money to 
purchase a more fuel-efficient compact car for 
commuting. However, you could rent a van or 
truck for the trip. There are multiple moving 
companies in the area with great rates. 
W:  I’m trying to reduce the cost of my relocation, so I 
think I’ll just ask someone else.

W:  I’m dissatisfied with Geller Distribution Services. 
Our retail outlet has received incorrect shipments 
of goods from them on multiple occasions over the 
previous six months. For instance, just last 
Tuesday we received 20 pairs of Eclipse 
basketball shoes, but I requested 25. Plus, the 
company has yet to address my complaints.
M:  I’ve noticed similar issues too. Considering the 
ongoing troubles that we’re experiencing with 
Geller, I think it would be best for us to partner 
with another firm. 
W:  In that case, I’ll reach out to other reputable 
distributors that service the Madison area. Once I 
narrow down our options to two or three 
prospective companies, we can hold formal 
meetings with their representatives.

M:  I’ve taken a look at your presentation slideshow 
for our marketing proposal to Upturn Incorporated 
in November. I have some feedback on it that I 
would like to discuss with you.
W:  Certainly. Let me just pull the file up on my 
computer quickly so that we can review it 
together. OK, what part did you want to talk 
about?
M:  I think you should add more content to the sixth 
slide by discussing the results from our market 
research. Specifically, you can note that we’ve 
included rainforest images in the billboards 
because Upturn’s target market responds 
positively to images of nature. 
W:  Sure. I’ll also put emphasis on how focus group 
participants responded more positively to red text 
than black text. Those results seem worth noting 
as well.

M:  I had some initial problems as well, but reading 
the user manual has been very helpful. I 
recommend that you do the same. A digital copy 
of it was e-mailed to everyone a couple of days 
ago.
W:  Oh, really? I never received the message. Can 
you forward it to me? I’d definitely like to look the 
manual over.
M:  Certainly. However, that’s odd that you weren’t 
included in the original e-mail. You’ll have to 
inform the manager about the matter to ensure 
that your address is attached to any future group 
messages. You wouldn’t want to miss out on any 
important announcements.

M:  Hello, Beth. This is John Peters calling from the 
payroll department. I want to let you know that I 
noticed an error on last month’s timesheets for 
one of your employees.
W:  Is that so? I made sure to double-check all of the 
sheets against my team’s schedule before 
approving them. Which employee are you 
referring to?
M:  Teresa Ford. Although she has a part-time shift, 
she entered 120 hours for the month of January. 
That’s about 40 more hours than she normally 
logs. 
W:  We actually increased her hours to 30 per week 
last month, and that situation will continue moving 
forward. I already informed the head of human 
resources about it, but I’ll call him right now and 
ask him to update the information in your 
database today.

plate number is DTG103. We ask the owner to please 
move the vehicle immediately. Also, as a reminder, 
hospital visitors must keep facility emergency areas 
clear of traffic at all times. To identify these areas, 
look for red and yellow stripes on the pavement. 
Anyone who parks their vehicle in one of these areas 
will be subject to a fine of up to $500 in accordance 
with state laws. We appreciate your cooperation.

Our tour of this chocolate factory will begin in just a 
moment, but first I’d like to provide some brief 
instructions and a tour outline. For starters, everyone 
will be asked to put on a green hard hat prior to 
entering the facility. As you will see, visitors wear 
green helmets while workers wear orange ones. This 
is in order to protect guests as well as help them 
identify and stay close to the group. Also, for your 
own safety, do not come into contact with the 
conveyor belts while walking through the factory. 
About halfway through the tour, we’ll take a short 
break, at which point refreshments will be provided. 
Then, at the end, we’ll have some free chocolate 
samples to hand out. OK, now let’s begin.

Hello, Ms. Olsen. I’m calling from Vine Express to let 
you know that we’re holding a package for you. One 
of our employees tried to deliver the item to your 
house three separate times, but you were not home 
on any of those occasions. Because the parcel needs 
to be signed for, you’ll have to pick it up at our sorting 
facility at 896 West Juniper Drive between 9 a.m. and 
5 p.m. If you don’t retrieve the package within seven 
days, it will be returned to the sender. For more

Winning a Blake Award for acting has always been a 
dream of mine, so it is such an honor to be here as a 
recipient tonight. I would like to take this opportunity 
to thank everyone who helped make tonight happen. 
Specifically, I’d like to acknowledge my director, 
Laura Dreston. I’ve been fortunate to work with her in 
the past and was glad to do so again for the highly 
acclaimed film Rivers Crossed, the movie that got me 
nominated for this award. And I can’t forget to show 
my gratitude to Harold Cross, our screenwriter, for 
creating such a wonderful script. Again, thank you all 
very much.

In business news, the local firm Computing Industries 
has announced plans to release the latest version of 
its mobile phone application, SpeakVid. The 
application, which allows users to record, edit, and 
share short video messages, has become hugely 
popular over the previous year, leading to a sharp rise 
in the developer’s stock prices. The upgrade is 
anticipated among consumers and investors alike. 
The general public is excited for the application’s 
updated interface, while business analysts predict 
that the move will expand the firm’s market base. 
Despite already attracting national media coverage, 
experts predict that interest in SpeakVid will continue 
to mount leading up to its official release next month.

I’m calling on behalf of Music Central in Newark, New

yesterday for a bulk shipment of electronics. As of 
now, the order is for 20 portable Kentmoore speakers, 
25 wireless Conquest microphones, and 25 Pure 
Sound noise-canceling headphones. However, we 
need 10 more Kentmoore speakers than were 
originally requested. If it’s not too late to add items to 
our order, please do so and bill us for the additional 
costs. Also, I’d appreciate it if you could e-mail me an

I want to take a few minutes to briefly go over our 
company’s launch plan for the ProGrip tennis 
racquets. Nearly 120 thousand tennis racquets will be 
made in our factories in Colombo and Kuala Lumpur 
for the item’s initial production run. We will then 
distribute the racquets mainly to online sporting goods 
retailers and chain athletic stores. Our advertising 
campaign will begin on March 10 and will include 
commercial broadcasts on TV and print ads in Active 
Next magazine. Moreover, professional tennis players 
Jeff Dent and Jennifer Wong from last year’s national 
team have expressed interest in endorsing the gear, 
and we are considering making a deal with them. 
Now, let’s talk about manufacturing expenses and 
pricing.

M:  I understand, ma’am. However, have you 
considered trying a more affordable cable bundle? 
For instance, we offer other options, such as 
Simple TV or TV First. They are inexpensive and 
ideal for those who prefer to watch only a limited 
number of channels. 
W:  I appreciate the suggestion, but I’d rather 
eliminate the expense altogether. 
M:  OK. I’ll go ahead and take care of your request.

M:  Good afternoon. My name is Frank Peters, and I 
have my yearly physical examination today with 
Dr. Murray. My appointment is at 10:45 a.m.
W:  Hello, Mr. Peters. Please wait while I pull up your 
records. Also, did you by chance bring your health 
insurance card today? If so, please place it on the 
counter.
M:  Yes, I have it right here. But may I ask what you 
need it for? Isn’t my insurance information already 
on file?
W:  All the state hospitals recently adopted a new  
record-sharing system that will keep patients like 
you from having to register personal information at 
each facility. I just want to confirm that your 
medical profile is in order following the upgrade.

M:  Hello. I’m calling from Riverside Business 
Institute, and I was hoping to reach Ms. Brenda 
Ling in regard to the advanced legal assistant 
course she completed last week.
W:  This is Ms. Ling. What can I do for you?
M:  I’m contacting the participants who went through 
the course to gather feedback. The responses we 
receive will help our organization to improve 
services and curriculum in the future. Would you 
be willing to answer some questions? It won’t take 
up much of your time.
W:  I’m actually quite busy at the moment. My 
schedule will be more flexible after noon, 
however. So you can try calling me back then. 
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Now that Mr. Fletcher has accepted a position at 
another company, we need to begin seeking 
someone to serve as the replacement chief 
accountant. We only have three more weeks. 
W:  I think we should look to promote someone from 
within our firm first rather than putting out a public 
job advertisement. It would reduce the amount of 
time spent interviewing candidates. Plus, we have 
multiple qualified people on staff. That approach 
worked well when the recruitment manager left 
last year. 
M:  I’m not so sure. I can’t think of any current 
employees who have enough experience for the 
role. Still, I’m willing to give it a try. Let’s send an 
internal e-mail about the opening and see who 
shows interest.

M:  Hi. This is Cody Tate calling from Bryant Park 
Activities Center. May I speak with Petra 
Reynolds? I’d like to talk to her about the 
neighborhood event she volunteered to work at 
tomorrow.
W:  This is Ms. Reynolds. And I assume you’re 
referring to the Bryant Arts and Crafts Fair. 
M:  That’s correct. According to our records, you 
committed to setting up booths at the fair. In 
addition to that, I’m wondering if you can work at 
the concession stand for a few hours once the 
event begins. The person who was assigned that 
responsibility has fallen ill, so you’d be standing in 
for her.
W:  Yes, of course. However, I can only stay until 
about 2 p.m., as I have another engagement later 
in the day.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Have you seen the latest financial report? Our 
market share has been dropping consistently for 
the past six months. Sales of all our cars are down 
from last year.
W:  Yes, I saw. It seems that smaller cars have 
become more popular during the current 
economic downturn because they’re more fuel 
efficient and cheaper to run. Maybe we’d better 
reconsider the company’s emphasis on trucks and 
SUVs.
M:  Actually, some board members have already 
decided to do that. They have hired an external 
consultant to provide recommendations on how 
we can modify our strategy and regain lost sales.
W:  We should have the head of marketing create a 
presentation with her own suggestions for 
overcoming the problem as well. All ideas would 
be helpful now. I’ll go and talk with her about that 
possibility.

Unfortunately, the two we have on our lot are

W:  Let me check the database. Yes, it appears we 
have three that would be appropriate. I can get a 
staff member to drive one to your location right 
away. It shouldn’t take him more than 15 minutes 
or so. 
M:  That’s great. I’m sure the customer won’t mind 
waiting. Just ask the employee to inform me once 
he has reached the facility. Thanks for the help.

W:  Mark Haman, a representative from the nonprofit 
organization Rhythm for All, contacted our office 
earlier this afternoon. His organization is in the 
process of planning a fund-raiser so that it can 
continue its mission of giving free piano and guitar 
lessons to underprivileged children. He asked if 
our soccer team could contribute items that can 
be auctioned off during the event. 
M:  We can definitely do that. Our team is always 
looking for ways to give back to the community. 
Why don’t we contribute a pair of tickets to a 
premium box for one of this year’s home 
matches? Also, we could give them limited edition 
jerseys of the team’s star players. 
W:  Those are both great ideas. I’m sure the items will 
fetch high offers. I’ll call Mr. Haman back and let 
him know.

Award. Mr. Chao was named one of our marketing

Welcome to Mississippi River Boat Tours. I’m Nori, 
and I’ll be your guide today as we travel up the river. 
First, let me tell you a bit about the boat we’re riding 
on, The Water Queen. Built in 1852, this vessel was 
originally used to carry cargo back and forth to 
various cities along the Mississippi, like New Orleans 
and Memphis. Then, about 30 years ago, it was 
converted into a tour boat, and seats were installed 
on both the top and lower decks. Now, our first stop 
today will be Johnsonville, where you’ll get to see the 
historical Welter Lighthouse.

I want to begin by saying that it has been a privilege 
and honor to devote the final two decades of my 
career to the Minnesota Consumer Protection 
Agency. As the department administrator, I oversaw 
the implementation and upholding of numerous laws 
and regulations that served to protect the rights and 
safety of consumers across the state. Being 
employed at the agency has given me a sense of 
pride in my work that I will always cherish. And 
although I look forward to spending more quality time 
with my family, I will sincerely miss working beside 
such a competent and professional group of people. 
So, thank you.

growing firm like ours, so we need to do our best to

Welcome to This Week in Brooklyn on Central Radio 
96.1 FM. On Tuesday, the latest phase of a project to 
redevelop the Bentham area was completed. A 
collectively owned establishment called Creative 
Brooklyn has been set up in an old toy factory, and it 
will use the renovated building to provide studios for 
artists. The space is going to open its doors this 
Friday, with painters, writers, musicians, and other 
artists from around New York holding a party in 
observance of the grand opening event. The 
developer of the site, who also converted the old 
Wentworth Warehouse into luxury apartments, hopes 
that it will serve to further vitalize the area by making 
it a center for cultural activity. Now, we’ll have a brief 
talk with one of the board members of Creative 
Brooklyn, Steven Godering.

M:  That’s right. I remember having a conversation 
about the inspection with you last Tuesday. Is 
there anything special that we should do before he 
arrives?
W:  Please scrub the appliances very well. He’ll be 
here at 7:30 a.m., so we won’t have time to get 
ready in the morning. 
M:  OK. I’ll make sure the stoves are spotless and the 
food preparation stations are in order before 
closing down this evening.

W:  Hello. I have a cell phone plan through your 
company, and I want to upgrade my existing cell 
phone. I’d like to know if I qualify for any 
discounts.  
M:  For the next month, customers can sell their 
phones to the store and put that money towards 
an upgrade. The deal applies to any of our newly 
developed devices, including the Verso X3 or 
Blade 4S. However, the amount that you’d receive 
for your current phone will depend on its condition. 
W:  That sounds like a great deal. Plus, I was 
considering buying the Verso X3 anyway. Could 
you look at my phone and let me know how much 
I can get for it?

W:  According to the tracking information, your book 
was delivered almost three days ago. However, 
the courier may not have brought it directly to your 
door if you didn’t include a unit number as a part 
of the shipping information. Do you remember 
doing that? 
M:  Hmm. I don’t recall, but I never saw the item by 
my complex’s main door either.
W:  Why don’t you talk to your building manager to 
find out whether the package is being held for 
you? Otherwise, you can get in touch with 
Package Express, the courier service, directly. 
They may be of assistance.

W:  Now that the Jorgensen Project has wrapped up, 
we can devote more attention to our other 
assignment. As we discussed previously, Felt 
Footwear has commissioned us to create radio 
commercials on the store’s behalf. So, we have to 
figure out how to frame the advertisements. 
M:  Actually, I came up with an idea this morning. 
Since summer is approaching, why don’t we focus 
on the store’s selection of outdoor footwear, such 
as running and hiking shoes? 
W:  That’s a good suggestion. But I think we should 
make a series of commercials that draw attention 
to the business’s large range of products. That 
way, consumers will know that the store sells 
more than just sporting gear.

M:  Our department is struggling to finalize the 
necessary financial reports for the upcoming 
stakeholders meeting. I’m sorry to ask on short 
notice, but can you work over the weekend?
W:  I’ll be out of town from Friday through next 
Tuesday. I’m visiting Charleston to be in my 
sister’s wedding. You approved my leave last 
month. 
M:  Oh, that’s right. Considering how busy we’ve been 
lately, I completely forgot. In that case, I’ll have to 
ask someone else from your team to do it. 
W:  Why don’t you check with Catherine Dawkins? 
She recently mentioned that she’d be open to 
working more overtime, as she’s saving up money 
to go to Europe.

W:  Good morning. My name is Clara Davis, and I’m 
interested in having a custom bookshelf built 
around my living room fireplace. You made me 
some beautiful cupboards in the past, so I’d like to 
hire you again. 
M:  I’d be happy to do that for you. However, I’m 
overwhelmed with work orders this month. Are 
you willing to wait until the beginning of July for 
your bookcase? That’s probably the earliest that I 
could get to it.
W:  I’m in no real rush to have the work completed, so 
that’s fine.
M:  I appreciate your flexibility. I’ll write down your 
name and telephone number and get in touch with 
you early next month. Then we can arrange a time 
for me to stop by your house and take the 
necessary measurements.

M:  Hi, Samantha. Do you know what our company 
policy for vacation requests is? I’d like to take 
some time off from February 20 to 25 when my 
kids are on winter break from school.
W:  You have to fill out a form on the human 
resources intranet site, which will be sent directly 
to your supervisor. You will then receive a 
notification indicating whether you have been 
granted approval approximately two weeks after 
making the request. However, several employees 
from our department have already submitted 
vacation requests for that same time period, so it 
may be difficult for you to get it approved.
M:  I see. Well, I think I’ll try anyway. Thanks for the 
instructions.

However, your submission seems to be missing 
some necessary documentation. In addition to 
your cover letter, résumé, and portfolio, we also 
need two letters of recommendation, which were 
not included.
M:  I’m very sorry about that. I thought I uploaded the 
documents to your site along with the other files, 
but I must have forgotten. How soon do you need 
them? 
W:  Just get them to us no later than noon tomorrow. 
That’s when I’m going to begin processing

I’m going to make photocopies of. I’m also 
planning to include it as an attachment in the 
reminder e-mail that will be sent to attendees. But 
why do you ask? Does the agenda need to be 
changed at all before I finalize it?
M:  Yes, actually. Helen’s presentation on marketing 
trends is going to be longer than originally 
expected, so please allow her an extra 15 
minutes. Also, Oliver will be unable to attend 
because he must provide consulting services to 
an important client. So, we’ll need to remove him 
from the agenda entirely. 
W:  No problem. I’ll take care of those amendments 
right now.

M:  Ms. Martinez, it’s Phillip Adler calling from Kerman

the revised service contract we sent you last 
week?
W:  Our legal team is taking a look at it now, Mr. Adler. 
They’ve told me most of the contract looks 
satisfactory, but some small changes will need to 
be made to the section on licensing fees.
M:  That sounds great. By the way, I heard that your 
company’s soft drink Orange Lite has become 
quite popular in Mexico ever since it was 
introduced this spring. Congratulations on the 
success thus far.
W:  Oh, thank you. Yes, sales have definitely 
outperformed our expectations. We hope to 
capitalize on the product’s popularity by continuing 
to extend distribution in the coming quarters.

We’ve now reached what’s probably the most famous 
painting in this collection, The Flames of Clouds. It 
was created by Guido Mariano and is believed to date 
back to 1821. As you can see, the picture uses a 
combination of bright orange and yellow paint, which 
was quite uncommon at the time it was made. This 
innovative technique gained Mariano a lot of praise 
among fellow painters and art critics of his era. OK, 
let’s move on and view some of our 20th century 
artworks. They’re located in the next gallery at the 
end of the hallway. Please follow me.

quite complicated, which is why we’ve asked

Welcome to Top Science on WRP 101.5. I’m your 
host, Nina Esteban. As a part of our ongoing podcast 
series on the impact of climate change, I’ve invited 
Dr. Luis Mattson from Fillmore College to the show. 
Dr. Mattson teaches in the school’s ecology 
department and, just this Monday, published a paper 
in a peer-reviewed journal. The paper examines the 
rise of sea levels along the United States coastline as 
a result of melting glaciers. Throughout today’s 
program, our guest is going to discuss his findings 
and respond to a few prominent critiques that his 
research has received. It’s a pleasure to have you 
here today, Dr. Mattson.

Attention, all attendees. This afternoon’s seminar on 
retailing has been postponed for 45 minutes. The 
convention room that was originally intended for the 
meeting was accidentally double-booked, and there 
are no other spaces available for use at this time. 
Consequently, participants are instructed to gather in 
Hall A at 3 o’clock instead of meeting in front of Hall C 
at 2:15. Aside from this minor delay, the seminar will 
carry on as originally planned and will still include a 
special talk from Stacy Vine, the sales director of 
Gibbers Clothing Outlet. In the meantime, we 
encourage participants to use the extra time to visit 
addi t ional  booths and network wi th  other 
professionals. We appreciate your understanding and 
apologize for any inconveniences that this may cause.

As most of you know, this is the final week of our 
annual three-month internship program. Whenever 
possible, the human resources department tries to 
award full-time contracts to the most exceptional 
interns based on the evaluations that you managers 
provide. Fortunately, there are a lot of people who 
received promising reviews this year, and we’ve 
decided to hire most of the interns from the financial 
division. We’re also going to have a small celebration 
on Friday afternoon to thank all the interns for their 
hard work. I’ve asked James Lin, our human 
resources manager, to organize the gathering, so 
expect to receive a memo from him regarding it 
sometime later today.

Attention, guests. This is an important schedule 
announcement. Beginning next week, trains arriving 
here at Mount Rushmore will be running on a limited 
schedule for six months, as the attraction receives 
relatively few visitors in the winter. During that time, 
trains will no longer arrive and depart every half hour. 
Instead, they will operate at 90-minute intervals. 
Please also remember that Big Buck Park, which is 
located on the way to Mount Rushmore, will be closed 
between the months of November and February. 
Consequently, trains will not stop at that station until 
March of next year. Thank you for your attention, and 
have a pleasant day.

According to a recent press conference held by the 
city’s mayor, Shenzhen will be launching a major 
campaign to attract foreign businesses. The campaign, 
which has been created by a Sydney-based publicity 
firm, focuses on the city’s low corporate tax rates and 
large labor market. Moreover, it draws attention to the 
fact that Shenzhen’s ever-growing population offers 
an excellent consumer base for a wide array of 
enterprises. Although Shenzhen is already well-known 
among Chinese nationals and continues to receive 
investments from abroad, officials feel that the city 
has yet to reach its full business potential. Officials 
are optimistic that the campaign will generate more 
attention from international entrepreneurs and increase 
tourism in the region as well. For further information 
about the campaign or to view any of its promotional 
materials, you can visit www.shenzhentourism.gov.cn.

Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Good evening. I ’m contacting fine dining 
establishments to find out whether they can 
accommodate large groups of people. My parents 
are celebrating 30 years of marriage in May, and 
15 members of my immediate family plan to hold a 
dinner in their honor.
W:  We regularly serve large parties, so that won’t be 
an issue. But I should warn you that we do have a 
mandatory 18 percent gratuity charge for groups 
of more than 10 people. So long as that’s OK, I’d 
be happy to hold some tables for you.
M:  Oh, the gratuity charge isn’t a concern. However, 
I’m still researching our dining options, so I’m not 
ready to book anything quite yet. But thanks for 
the information.

M:  Hello, this is Benjamin Williams, a clerk at the 
South County Court House. I was informed on 
Monday that an employee from the Conroy Police 
Department would forward me some files related 
to a legal case that’s under review. It’s now 
Wednesday, and I have yet to receive anything.
W:  I apologize for that, Mr. Williams. But every time I 
try to send them, the message is marked as 
unde l iverab le .  Your  e -mai l  address  is 
benwilliams@southcounty.gov, correct?
M:  No, I was issued a different address because my 
previous one was exper iencing a login 
complication. All future messages should be 
delivered to benwilliams1@southcounty.gov. 
W:  I see. I’ll forward them to you right after updating 
your contact information in our departmental 
records.

영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  This is Marcie, and I’m calling to say that I won’t 
be able to come to the store today. I’m very sorry 
for the short notice, but I rolled my ankle while 
taking my morning run and have to go to the clinic 
to get it examined. I’m worried it might be 
sprained.
M:  I completely understand. However, have you tried 
to find someone else to cover for you?
W:  Neither Andrea nor Wilson answered their 
phones, so I wasn’t able to arrange for anyone to 
pick up my shift. If you want, I can continue 
attempting to reach one of them.
M:  Normally, I’d ask you to, but I think we can 
manage being shorthanded today since we 
haven’t had too many customers recently. I’ll just 
work one of the cash registers if we get busy.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Welcome to the Wings Plaza. Did you reserve a 
room with us in advance, or would you like to rent 
one now?
W:  I have a reservation for four days and three nights 
under the name Melissa Long. I also made a 
special request for breakfast to be brought to my 
room daily at 6 a.m.
M:  Of course, we can take care of that for you. By the 
way, your customer profile indicates that you have 
enough reward points through our hotel chain to 
qualify for a complimentary room upgrade. I can 
arrange for you to stay in an executive suite if 
you’re interested. 
W:  Thank you, but I think I’ll redeem the points during 
a longer trip that I’m planning to take in two 
weeks. 
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  I just read the consumer questionnaire that you 
turned in to me. All the questions are very strong, 
but I’d like a few additional queries to be added to 
it. 
M:  That’s fine. If you supply me with the extra 
questions, I’ll incorporate them into the survey, 
and then it should be ready for us to use for 
consumer research. 
W:  Great. By the way, once you’ve made the changes, 
share the final copy with Megan McHale. She’s 
going to be in charge of conducting some upcoming 
focus groups and will need it. 
M:  Given my workload, I can’t guarantee to finish the 
assignment before the end of today’s shift, but I’ll 
take care of it soon. 
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  Have you received any information related to the 
product certification for the prescription medicine 
that our firm is developing? I haven’t heard 
anything about its status in at least two weeks.  
M:  As far as I know, the medicine is still being 
evaluated by the government. That process takes 
roughly a month to complete, so we won’t hear 
back about it for another 10 to 14 days. 
Nevertheless, given the extensive testing that we 
conducted on the medication to ensure that it 
meets all the relevant safety criteria, I’d be 
shocked i f  the drug isn’ t  approved for 
consumption.
W:  You’re most likely right. The results of the testing 
were promising. Well, be sure to touch base with 
me once you receive the results of the evaluation.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  I’ve made the necessary preparations for the 
virtual meeting with our Taiwanese partners,  
Ms. Lor. They agreed to talk with us regarding 
their corporate cash flow at 1 p.m. They would also 
like us to give a brief presentation on the recent 
reduction of our liabilities.  
W:  Excellent. Now, our videoconference equipment 
needs to be readied for use. I don’t want the 
conference call to cut out like it did during our 
previous meeting. It was very frustrating when the 
screen went blank in the middle of discussions.
M:  I’ll find our technical assistant and instruct him to 
check all the cable connections and verify that the 
camera is in working order. We’ll take the 
necessary precautions. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Excuse me. I’m thinking about buying this utility 
rack to use for storing tools and sporting gear in 
my garage. Although I really like that the product 
is made out of metal and very sturdy, it seems 
fairly complicated to construct. The instructions in 
its manual are hard to make sense of. 
W:  Since this is one of our most popular storage 
racks and a lot of customers have given us similar 
feedback, we created a video on how to put it 
together, which can be found on our store Web 
site. The video is quite straightforward, so I’m 
confident that you’ll be able to follow along.
M:  Oh, that’s extremely helpful. I’ll go ahead and get 
this then.

W:  Mr. Collins, you’re now in charge of the entire 
overseas sales department, isn’t that correct? The 
consolidated budget reports from July are done, 
but I’m not sure if I am supposed to give them to 
you.
M:  I am. However, the reports should be provided to 
the head accountant, Steve Simone. Upper 
management recently restructured our firm’s 
division of labor, and the accounting department is 
now responsible for reviewing them first.
W:  In that case, I’ll stop by his office right now to drop 
everything off. 
M:  Actually, Mr. Simone is currently in a meeting with 
the corporate attorney, so why don’t you try 
leaving the documents with his assistant?
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Thank you for calling Vaughn Incorporated. My 
name is Lance. What can I do for you?
W:  According to one of your flyers, your company 
rents out water dispensers with internal filters for a 
recurring monthly fee of $50, and customers are 
able to upgrade the appliances at no additional 
charge whenever new ones are released. That 
sounds great, but I’m curious how much water a 
single device can hold. The leaflet didn’t make 
that clear.
M:  Our current models can hold up to 500 gallons, 
and a single filter can strain over 2,000 gallons 
before needing to be replaced. Also, I’m not sure if 
you’re already aware, but customers can save 15 
percent on their total monthly fee if they lease two 
or more appliances. So you should consider 
renting a coffee maker or air purifier as well.

Questions 71-73 refer to the following broadcast.
미국식	발음
This is Haley Nicks with another Complete Radio 
news update. For the third straight week, over 10 
counties across Texas continue to be affected by 
extreme rainfall shortages. As a consequence, the 
state governor has set a temporary limit on the 
amount of water that residents in the impacted 
counties can use during the drought. Households that 
consume over 300 gallons per day will receive minor 
fines. Moreover, a ban on the use of lawn sprinklers 
has also been instituted until further notice. Experts 
predict that the next sizeable rainfall is two weeks 
away, so the restrictions will most likely continue for 
at least that long.

If you are over the age of 65 and find it difficult to use 
public transportation, consider trying Easy Mobility, 
Auckland’s official senior citizen transport service. 
The advantages of Easy Mobility over conventional 
buses are numerous. They include home pickup and 
drop-off options, customizable schedules, and 
guaranteed wheelchair accessibility. But best of all, 
the fare is only $1 per ride, and people with low or 
federally subsidized incomes qualify for an additional 
50 percent off their tickets. There is really no better 
way for elderly residents to travel around the 
metropolitan area! To learn about the neighborhoods 
served by Easy Mobility or to schedule a ride, just call 
555-2456. 
Questions 77-79 refer to the following announcement.

I’m sure many of you have already heard, but a toy 
drive is being hosted here at Ferris Mall throughout 
the month of December called Gifts for Girls and 
Boys. The goal of the event is to collect new toys and 
clothing for children in need. The donated items will 
be distributed to kids throughout New Holmes City 
before the start of the approaching holiday season. If 
you would like to participate in the drive, you may 
contribute new toys, board games, or articles of 
clothing. All contributions should be placed in the bin 
that I’ve set up in our store’s back room. Any amount 
of generosity would be greatly appreciated. 
Questions 80-82 refer to the following introduction. 
영국식	발음
For those of you whom I have yet to meet, my name

opportunity to let everyone know how excited I am to 
collaborate with such a talented team of production 
staff. You all do an excellent job here, which is 
evident in the overall quality of the network’s daily 
news shows. In fact, I have long been a fan of 
Channel 5 News in part because the technical 
aspects of the program are so well executed. I intend 
to add to that success and look forward to building 
professional relationships with each of you in the

미국식	발음
Welcome to Blitz Health. I’m Lenard Bolden, the 
instructor for this exercise course. Our goal today is to 
give you a leg workout. In order to do so, you all will 
be carrying out five different exercise routines, 
ranging from stationary jogging to using the weight 
lifting equipment on the far side of the room. I’m also 
going to have you keep a steady pace as you 
alternate between routines so that you keep your 
heart rate elevated. This will facilitate a good 
cardiovascular workout to supplement the strength 
training that you’ll be primarily concentrating on. 
However, I first want everyone to find a spot on the 
mat with enough space to stretch out. 
Questions 89-91 refer to the following instructions. 
영국식	발음
I want to briefly go over the steps that you should take 
when trying to convince customers to renew their 
magazine subscript ions. First,  remind them  
that our monthly publication, Cookware National, is 
well-respected thanks to its high-quality writing and 
that we regularly receive acclaim from independent 
reviewers. Second, explain that a subscription to the 
print version of Cookware National magazine 
automatically qualifies customers to gain total access 
to our online content. This includes special Web-only 
articles and editorials. Finally, inform them that all 
renewing subscribers will receive one edition of the 
publication for free. More often than not, highlighting 
these points is enough to encourage people to remain 
customers for another year. 
Questions 92-94 refer to the following talk. 
호주식	발음
We are gathered here this afternoon to discuss what 
it takes to operate a Veggie Hut fast food franchise. 
As a representative from the company’s central office, 
I will explain the food preparation, interior decoration, 
and marketing strategy guidelines that our company 
requires franchise owners to meet. We will then go 
over our firm’s profitability expectations and the initial 
costs associated with opening one of our restaurants. 
Staffing and training fees will be also covered. The 
event will conclude with a slideshow detailing the 
level of support that all individual owners will receive 
from the head office to ensure that their business 
thrives as much as possible. OK, why don’t we begin?

with you as soon as possible. 
Questions 98-100 refer to the following excerpt from a workshop.
미국식	발음
Now that I’ve introduced myself and explained my 
history as a consultant, I’d like to continue with 
today’s workshop on how to build a professional 
network by having everyone take part in a group 
exercise. The exercise will underscore the main 
message of my upcoming lecture, which is that first 
impressions are essential to creating long-standing 
business associations. OK, so first, find a partner 
near you. Then, take turns introducing yourselves to 
one another. As your partner is talking, jot down some 
simple notes indicating the impression that he or she 
makes on you. At the end of the workshop, you’ll 
share your notes and discuss how each of you could 
have improved upon the first impression you made by 
incorporating the tips that I will share with you over 
the next two hours.

M:  Excuse me. I want to buy these running shoes, 
but the pairs on the shelf are too small for me. Do 
you have a size 10 in stock? 
W:  Another customer bought our last pair in that size 
about half an hour ago, so I’m afraid we don’t. 
M:  I see. Well, I really like these shoes and would be 
willing to visit a different branch today in order to 
purchase them. Could you call one of your nearby 
store locations and ask if it has any left?
W:  Why don’t you walk over to the service counter? 
The clerk there can contact our store off Highway

most, the task will take us a couple of hours to 
complete, so we should be done with it by 
lunchtime.
M:  OK, but before we unload the plants from the 
truck, holes need to be dug for the bushes. I’ll get 
our shovels and work gloves.
W:  Could you a lso br ing over  one of  the 
wheelbarrows? We’ll use it to haul away the

영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Martin Marquez, the recently appointed Northeast 
regional manager, has made arrangements to 
come to our headquarters. The visit will give him 
an opportunity to acquaint himself with our 
chairperson for the first time. He will be coming on 
December 3, which is one month away. 
M:  Hasn’t a consultant been hired to give a talk on 
that date on how four-day workweeks can lead to 
increased productivity? If so, it might be hard to fit 
everything into the agenda, as there will be a lot of 
activities going on. 
W:  I’ve actually requested that Mr. Marquez stop by 
on the same day so he can sit in on the talk. I 
think he would really benefit from it because it’s 
going to be targeted at middle management. 
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Ever since a second bakery opened on our block 
in January, our sales have dropped slightly. 
Although the decrease has been fairly insignificant 
thus far, we should be proactive about trying to 
prevent future losses. 
W:  I completely agree. To my mind, our best plan of 
action would be to vary the goods that we sell. For 
instance, we could begin baking a larger variety of 
muffins and pastries. 
M:  I’ve spoken with patrons who have expressed an 
interest in us doing that, so it would most likely go 
over well. However, expanding our menu will 
require us to make logistical changes, such as 
acquiring more ingredients every week and 
possibly finding another baker. So, please begin 
putting together a business plan that takes those 
factors into consideration.
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  Thank you for meeting with me, Mr. Gabo. Now, 
I’m going to explain why your retail outlet should 
be stocking the DirtDuster XE residential vacuum 
cleaner. First, the DirtDuster has a motor attached 
to the wheels, making the device self-propelled. 
Plus, it can be used on hard surfaces as well as 
carpets. 
M:  I don’t know. We already offer the SwiftClean E12, 
which also works on wood floors. I’m not sure if 
that’s a convincing enough reason to purchase 
your device. 
W:  But unlike the SwiftClean, the DirtDuster is 
guaranteed not to leave scratches on any 
surfaces. Consumer polls indicate that this is a 
major selling point for most people.
M:  Well, I’d like you to show me how the vacuum 
operates before I decide. You can use it on that 
rug. 
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Jake and I have been asked to take five Japanese 
representatives from a client company out next 
week, and we’re struggling to think of something 
fun to do with them rather than simply going to eat 
at a fancy restaurant.
M:  You should consider chartering a yacht and taking 
them sailing for an evening. If you go around 
sunset, you’d be able to enjoy some incredible 
views of the Miami cityscape. 
W:  That’s a wonderful suggestion, but would our boss 
approve that type of excursion considering how 
much it would likely cost?  
M:  It’s more affordable than you would expect. 
Yachts can be rented from local businesses for as 
little as $1,200 a day. Our company has spent 
more than that on expensive meals for similar 
sized groups. 
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Good morning. I own a small pottery shop in the 
city’s historic district, and I need a wooden, hand-
carved signboard to be made for my business to 
attract tourists from the street. Can you give me a 
price estimate for the service?
W:  I’m happy to assist you, but I need a few more 
details about the signboard first. Specifically, how 
large do you want it to be? Moreover, have you 
already designed the sign, or will one need to be 
created?
M:  It should be about one meter tall and half a meter 
wide, and I’d like a design featuring the shop’s 
logo to be made.
W:  OK. Just note that more generic signs which only 
include store names are cheaper than ones that 
incorporate logos. The price difference between 
the two could be up to $150.

locker rooms, so let’s head back to the main 
concourse. From there, we can walk to the next 
destination of your personal tour.
M:  I must say, it looks as though the money that my 
partners and I invested in the basketball stadium 
has been put to good use. The renovations that 
I’ve seen thus far have turned out great. The 
newly renovated court is especially impressive. 
The Ravens’ players must be very pleased with 
the results. 
W:  Absolutely. In fact, many of them commented on 
how nice the court is after practicing on it for the 
first time last week. Now, if you follow me this 
way, I’ll show you around the new luxury suites, 
including the one that investors such as yourself

W:  The concert hall’s ventilation system doesn’t seem 
to be functioning very well. It’s becoming quite 
muggy in here, and people are complaining about 
being uncomfortable. We need to figure out some 
other way of regulating the temperature before it 
gets any worse. 
M:  Try propping the side doors open once the 
intermission begins. They lead directly outside, 
and opening them will let in the breeze. Hopefully 
that will be sufficient for the time being. 
W:  That should work. But we’ll need to close all the 
doors again prior to the performance restarting, 
right? 
M:  Yes. Otherwise, the sound from the speakers 
might disturb people living in the apartment 
complex across the street. We don’t want to cause 
any issues with local residents.

consumer goods. She is going to tell us about her 
organization’s ongoing initiative to get regulation 
passed through Congress to ban the use of toxic 
plastics in children’s toys. Isn’t that correct, Ms. 
Schumacher?

cause that we submitted to the legislature. 
Moreover, I’ll be detailing some other strides that

Although the T-shirts that my firm is designing for 
your organization are supposed to be ready by this 
Thursday, they will not be done by then. One of our 
staff members was sick the last two days, so the work 
is taking longer than expected to finish. Unfortunately, 
we won’t be able to send the completed products to 
you until Friday. I’m very sorry, and we intend to take 
10 percent off your final bill to make up for the delay. 
If you have any inquiries regarding the matter, please

enough to avoid any major security issues so far, but 
more robust preventative measures need to be taken. 
That’s why I’ve instructed Thomas Haverford from the 
technology department to devise an online computer 
safety course for you all. The course will take about 
an hour to finish and detail some basic procedures 
that reduce the likelihood of devices becoming 
infected with malicious software. You’re welcome to

you do it within the next two weeks.

Hello, Mr. Hedrick. This is Vivian Moyer from Slate 
Real Estate, and I have some good news about the 
apartment that you’re trying to sublease through our 
firm. A visiting researcher at Forest University named 
Yi Pao contacted me to inquire about renting your 
home from June 1 to August 29. He wants the 
apartment to remain furnished, so you wouldn’t need 
to remove most of your belongings. However, he did 
request that your items be taken off the desk, as he’ll 
need to use it for his studies. Although you and I 
discussed trying to lease the apartment until late 
September, I strongly suggest considering this tenant 
because few other people have shown interest in the 
unit. Please call me at 555-1235 to talk about the 
situation.

this four-day retreat for managers in order to express 
gratitude for the hard work that you have done. She 
recognizes that you all strive to perform at a high level

firm’s success. Now, in addition to relaxing and 
enjoying this beautiful resort, we’re going to carry out 
a few team-building exercises together over the 
oncoming days. While the exercises are designed to 
be lighthearted and fun, they will also give you a 
chance to enhance your communication abilities. The 
first one will take place in about three hours from now

This message is for Richard Brendholt. My name is 
Emma Compton, and I’m the principal at Charleston 
Elementary School. I’m calling because we’re hosting 
a Career Day early next month as a way of 
introducing students to different vocations that they 
could possibly pursue in the future, and it would be 
wonderful if you could send a representative from 
your fire hall to the event. Many of our pupils find your 
line of work fascinating. I’m certain that they’d

someone, they’ll need to give a 10-minute talk about 
their job and show some of their gear. Either way, 
please confirm your decision with me by Monday, 
March 23. Thanks.
Questions 86-88 refer to the following introduction.
영국식	발음
I’d like to formally welcome Mr. George Chen, the 
new director of the Parks Department here in the city 
of Capeville. Mr. Chen was recommended for the 
position by multiple city councilors because he has 
been a longtime supporter of environmental initiatives 
in Capeville. One that you may be familiar with is his 
successful effort from last year to get Capeville 
manufacturers to adopt measures that prevent 
chemical runoff from contaminating local waterways. 
Given Mr. Chen’s experience, I believe that he’s 
going to thrive at our agency and contribute useful 
ideas about how we might better direct our limited 
financial resources to preserve the surrounding 
ecosystem. 
Questions 89-91 refer to the following speech.

The Snow and Ice Festival has grown considerably in 
recent years, and it now attracts visitors from well 
beyond the Cleveland metropolitan area. In fact, 
roughly 13 percent of the guests last winter were from 
overseas. This influx of international travelers has a 
very positive impact on the local economy. That is 
why we, as members of the event’s planning 
committee, have been tasked with figuring out how to 
best promote the festival to international audiences to 
continue this trend. As we discuss the matter, keep in 
mind that most guests find the snow sculptures and 
ice palace to be the two most impressive features of 
the festival. So, emphasizing those attractions in our 
campaign would make sense. All right, I’d now like 
everyone to split up into small groups and brainstorm 
possible promotion methods before reconvening in 
half an hour.

The following are some troubleshooting guidelines for 
common problems with the Plush SE mobile phone. 
You can use these techniques when helping 
customers who contact our call center to report 
complications. If a small red light appears on top of 
the device, it means that the battery is no longer able 
to hold a sufficient charge and must be replaced. This 
can be done by sliding the lid off the back of the 
phone,  removing the o ld bat tery f rom i ts 
compartment, and inserting a fresh one. If the phone 
is shutting off without warning, it should be manually 
restarted, which will cause it to install any necessary 
software updates. To do so, hold down the button on 
the left side of the phone for five seconds. After this, 
the phone will turn off and then start again. More 
serious issues must be dealt with by addressing your 
technical support manual.

I am very pleased to see you all here for tonight’s

for the first time at as prestigious a venue as the 
Maintown Cinema. Once the film is finished, I am 
going to explain a little bit about its production and the 
event in my life that gave rise to its premise. I will also 
devote about an hour to answering questions from the 
audience. I welcome you all to stick around and take 
part in that activity. Again, thank you, and I truly hope 
you enjoy the motion picture.

on Radio 109. The CEO of Automotive World 
announced this morning that, after a decade of 
instability, the company is going out of business. 
Despite numerous efforts to cut costs and attract 
more customers, the auto repair chain has 
experienced a steady decline in profits over the last 
five years. Across the state, 20 branches will be shut 
down in March, resulting in the layoff of over 200 
mechanics. However, the remaining buildings may 
not stay vacant for very long. That’s because 
Automotive World is in ongoing talks with potential 
buyers regarding a suitable sale price for its facilities. 
While any possible sale will not prevent the company 
from becoming insolvent, it would allow shareholders 
to recoup some money.

W:  I just found out that I’ll be flying overseas for work 
again beginning on June 3. I have to represent our 
management consultancy firm in Osaka, Japan 
and Beijing, China. 
M:  Didn’t you recently return from Johannesburg, 
South Africa? Traveling continuously must be very 
tiring for you. 
W:  It can be, but this trip will be a bit different. My 
business meetings in Osaka should conclude on 
June 6, and I don’t have to fly to Beijing until June 
9. So, I’ll get to spend a few days exploring Japan.
M:  Oh, great! I actually vacationed there last year. If 
you want, I can send you a link to an excellent 
travel blog about the country. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.

M:  I’m not sure if you’ve been informed yet, but our 
organization is going to host a banquet on 
January 4 to give thanks to our corporate donors. 
I’ve already asked CEOs from over 30 companies 
that have funded our research into cures for rare 
illnesses to come.
W:  Carly Weiss told me about the gathering a few 
minutes ago. She also said that one of our 
researchers from abroad is going to give a talk 
about how our advertising campaign to raise 
awareness about new medications is progressing. 
Is that true?
M:  It is. Linda Marr plans to give a presentation on 
the topic. She’ll also hand out an award to our top 
corporate contributor, Renewed Power.

you still in a position to accept the post? 
M:  Absolutely! But I’m a bit concerned about the start 
date. You stated previously that whomever you 
hire would need to begin on July 1, right? 
However, that’s only 10 days from now, and my 
contract stipulates that I must work for two weeks 
after handing in my resignation. I don’t foresee my 
employer making an exception in this case.
W:  That’s not a problem, as we’re willing to work 
around your time constraints. You won’t need to 
report to our office until the second week of 
August. So, you’ll be able to fulfill your obligations.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.

M:  I’m wondering if you’ve managed to check the 
latest version of the rental application form I 
e-mailed you yesterday regarding the vacant retail 
store in Benton Shopping Outlet. If you don’t think 
the document needs to be revised in any way, I’ll 
go ahead and send it to the woman who wants to 
rent the space. 
W:  Sorry, but I haven’t had any free time to review it 
because of the real estate investment seminar I 
facilitated this morning. But I’ll look over it quickly 
during my lunch break.
M:  Thanks. And just so you know, I want to deliver 
the application to the woman by 3 o’clock this 
afternoon, so I’ll need it before then.
W:  I should be able to check everything in time. 
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.

W:  Hi. I’m looking for a duffel bag that I can use as 
my carry-on luggage when I board my connecting 
flight. The handle on my current one has been 
torn. Since this suitcase store is located so close 
to my gate, I figure I might as well replace it. 
M:  OK, I can help you with that. Is there any 
particular style or color that you’d prefer? 
W:  My main priority is to buy something that is fairly 
light and has a lot of exterior pockets. I’d like to 
keep things like my phone, passport, and books 
easily accessible. 
M:  No problem. We have several options that meet 
that description. Please follow me this way, and I’ll 
show you what’s in stock.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  There’s been a change to our corporate employee 
evaluation worksheet. I’d like you to message the 
various branch managers about this development 
at some point before your shift ends. 
W:  Certainly, Mr. Victor. However, what makes the 
new worksheet different from the previous one? It 
will be necessary for me to include those details in 
the e-mail that I send out. 
M:  We’ve added two new evaluation criteria that 
focus on how staff interact with their colleagues 
and whether they’ve part icipated in any 
professional workshops, seminars, or training 
programs. The other executives and I feel this 
information should be taken into account when 
assessing staff’s overall performance and 
progress. 
W:  OK. Also, should the managers have any 
questions about the changes, I’ll be sure to 
forward them to you. 
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Have you been to the flea market on Greenway 
Avenue? I’d like to pick up an end table and a 
mirror for my apartment, and I’m considering 
checking it out this weekend. 
W:  I go there fairly regularly. There is a wide selection 
of used goods, antiques, and furniture. You can 
find some excellent bargains if you look carefully. 
M:  Do you have plans this Sunday? If not, maybe we 
could meet for breakfast and then go to the 
market together. The meal would be my treat.
W:  I’m open to that. The market opens at 9 a.m., so 
let’s meet at Dark Horse Café at 8 o’clock.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  Mitch, I’d like to speak with you briefly. I have 
some important printouts to give you. This is the 
standard employee handbook for all incoming 
structural engineers, while this file contains 
documents that outline our ongoing projects. 
Please look everything over as soon as you can. 
M:  Thank you, Ms. Pickney. However, I’ll be quite 
busy over the next two days with orientations, 
arranging my office, and introducing myself to the 
rest of the staff. So, I unfortunately won’t be able 
to read both the manual and this collection of 
documents before the week’s end. Is there one 
that you’d like me to prioritize?
W:  Since the handbook deals with more general 
information, start with the file on our projects.  
It would be nice for you to be up to date and in a 
position to contribute at our company meeting on 
Thursday. 
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Why don’t we also post the video to our company 
pages on social networking sites like ConnectUs 
and Friend Place? Doing so would give the video 
more exposure to consumers. 
W:  Yes, I agree. We could also include questions 
about the product on our social media pages and 
allow consumers to win rewards by providing 
correct answers. As for the prizes, participants 
could be given coupons or even autographed 
albums from Ms. Stalks. 
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation.

M:  I appreciate your patience, Ms. Zackary. The 
matter that I had to address took longer to deal 
with than I was expecting. Now, what can I assist 
you with today?
W:  I’m here to determine what type of vehicle loan I 
qualify for. I visited a car dealership last week to 
see different vehicles and found a sedan that I’d 
like to purchase, but it costs nearly $18,000. I’m 
not sure whether I’ll be able to get such a large 
loan from the credit union. Moreover, in the event 
that I can receive one, I’d like to learn more about 
what the terms for borrowing such a sum would 
be.
M:  Given your credit score and current income, you 
easily qualify for a vehicle loan of up to $20,000. 
Plus, since you have accumulated membership 
points over the last five years, you can also have 
your interest rate lowered from 3.5 percent to 2 
percent.

호주식	발음
Thank you all for coming to this meeting on short 
notice. I want to inform everyone that the exterior of 
our apartment complex is going to be repainted from 
April 10 through 15. As the property caretaker, it’s my 
responsibility to ensure that nobody uses the 
sidewalks or parking spots along the side of the 
building during that time. This is to provide the 
painters sufficient room to carry out their work as well 
as to protect people and vehicles from falling paint 
chips and drops. So, please make use of our 
underground garage or the more distant lot during 
those dates. I know this will be an inconvenience, so I 
appreciate your cooperation.

Hello. My name is Elisa Daru. I’m calling regarding 
some artwork that I think might be of interest to your 
museum. It recently came to my attention that you’ve 
opened a permanent exhibit on Chinese civilization. I 
own two rare Chinese bowls that are nearly 400 years 
old, and I’d like to donate them to be included in the 
collection in honor of my grandmother. Both of the 
artifacts are in superb condition. Moreover, three 
different authorized appraisers have looked at the 
pieces, and they each gave me certificates to prove 
the pottery’s authenticity. Please contact me at 555-

forward to hearing from you.

In order to improve efficiency, waiters and waitresses 
will be provided with tablet computers with special 
software to take orders from diners. The software 
allows servers to select menu items from a list as 
customers ask for them. Once entered, all the 
information will be forwarded to a monitor in the 
kitchen that the chefs can read. Although this process 
is certainly different from what we do now, it shouldn’t 
be too hard to figure out. Plus, we’ll be holding a short 
training session in two weeks for everyone to practice 
operating the equipment. We’ll then put the tablets 
into use on the following day.

Thank you for visiting our booth at the TechnoFinance 
Trade Fair. I’d like to take a moment to describe my 
company’s newest invention, the Personal Investment 
Station. The device, which is still undergoing 
development, can quickly provide users with basic 
investment information and explain the benefits and 
drawbacks of different investment strategies. To 
receive recommendations about which types of 
approaches suit your needs, just follow the simple 
instructions shown on the touch screen. To receive 
the most accurate advice possible, you will have to 
answer all 15 questions in the basic assessment 
survey. Following that process, a detailed set of 
investment suggestions will be printed out for you to 
keep for later reference. Now, I invite a volunteer from 
the audience to give the product a trial in front of 
everyone.

This is Gabriel Lopez from San Francisco Electronics 
Outlet, and I’m calling for Ms. Renton. I looked at your 
microwave oven today, and while I initially thought 
that the appliance was only going to require a new 
fuse, the problem is more complex than that. As it 
turns out, a few other parts are in need of 
replacement too. A cooling fan, a circuit, and some 
internal wiring are all in bad condition. I can certainly 
put in new components, but I advise against it, as the 
cost of the parts and labor will be more than a brand 
new appliance. I suggest stopping by our store to buy 
a new product instead. If you decide to do so, I’d be 
happy to dispose of your old oven at no additional 
charge.
Questions 89-91 refer to the following news report. 
호주식	발음
This is The News Update on PPRX Radio. I’m your 
host, Frank Hogan. Following a year of work, 
construction of a bus terminal at the Middleton 
Central Train Station will end on September 19. Once 
completed, the addition will function as Middleton’s 
main bus station. The project is aimed at establishing 
a transportation hub where residents can have easy 
access to the city’s primary modes of public 
transportation. Dozens of restaurants and stores will 
also be opening in the facility in hopes of capitalizing 
on the large crowds that are expected to visit daily. 
After a commercial break, I’ll be joined by Maggy 
Fulton, a city planner who is serving as an adviser for 
the project. So, stay tuned to learn more.

Today marks 10 years since Nobbles Industries was 
founded. Although that is not a very long time, much 
about our company has changed during that period. 
For starters, we have managed to increase our profit 
margins from $300,000 to over $10 million a year. We 
have also succeeded in becoming the fastest-growing 
snack foods manufacturer in Ireland, with the popular 
convenience store chain Total Shop giving us 
exclusive rights to market our goods at their checkout 
lanes. These are very impressive accomplishments 
for our company, which we should be proud of. Now, I 
am going to play a recorded thank-you message from 
our CEO, John McKinney, who regretfully could not 
attend tonight’s anniversary dinner. Please direct your 
attention to the screen to your right.

Can I have your attention, please? Now that everyone 
has arrived here at Medica Plus’s headquarters, I’m 
going to lead you all to the company’s private 
technology laboratory, which is a security zone. Any 
guests who enter the laboratory are required to 
present an identification badge to the guards. This 
measure is intended to regulate who accesses the 
facility and make sure that our ongoing research 
remains completely confidential. As visiting engineers 
from our partner company, Insight Incorporated, you 
have already completed and signed our non-disclosure 
forms. You have also been assigned temporary 
passes, which you must wear around your neck at all 
times. Should anyone be found in the laboratory 
without a pass displayed, they will be promptly 
escorted back to our lobby. So, we ask you to please 
take our security procedures seriously in order to 
avoid unnecessary complications.

Yesterday afternoon, the Bureau of Education named 
Ingles High School as a recipient of the Strive Award 
in recognition of its level of educational excellence. 
Over the previous four years, students at Ingles have 
consistently elevated their average standardized 
exam scores, and this progress has garnered praise 
from across the state. Furthermore, many of the 
school’s individual faculty members won teaching 
awards last fall for putting in additional time to tutor 
struggling students in a special evening program. 
These factors were cited as the primary reasons why 
the school was selected for the award. A ceremony 
will be held next Tuesday afternoon in the Ingles High 
School auditorium to bestow a certificate to Principal 
Marla Skinner in honor of the achievement. Residents 
are welcome to join.

Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.

M:  It’s time that we seriously consider adding more 
tables to our café. With how popular we’ve 
become this summer, we often have to turn away 
patrons, which is bad for business. 
W:  Yes, we’d definitely benefit from having another 
seating area. But where could it be put? I feel as 
though we’re already making good use of the 
space. 
M:  How do you feel about having one of the display 
cases removed and arranging tables to the left of 
the entrance? 
W:  That might work. Let’s try doing it tonight. I think 
there are extra tables in the basement that we can 
use.
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  May I speak with Andy Grace? I’m trying to 
contact him on behalf of Oakland Roofing about a 
voice mail he left for us an hour ago.
M:  This is he. Thanks for returning my call so quickly. 
As I mentioned in my voice mail, a small section of 
my roof was damaged during last Sunday’s 
thunderstorm. One of your representatives came 
to my house two days ago to carry out an 
appraisal. He mentioned that the shingles near the 
gutter on one side were in particularly bad shape, 
which would be fa i r ly  cost ly  to repair . 
Unfortunately, he never e-mailed me a final quote 
like he said he would.
W:  I apologize about that, Mr. Grace. I’ll contact the 
person who visited your home, get the quote, and 
then call you back. You should hear from me 
again shortly.

begin your new position?
M:  Ms. Tang is going to give me a walk-through of 
the position over the next month before she 
retires. But I’m not scheduled to officially take over 
for her until June. By the way, someone will have 
to be hired to fill my role as our department store’s 
associate manager. I heard from an HR employee 
that the company is looking for an internal 
replacement for the position. Why don’t you apply 
for the job? You’d be an excellent fit.
W:  I appreciate the compliment, but given that I just 
became the head of the kitchenware department a 
month ago, I think it’s too soon to try applying for 
another role.
M: Yes, that’s definitely understandable.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Hello. My wife and I are thinking about booking a 
trip to Cuba in February. Does your travel agency 
have any current deals for that destination?
W:  We offer multiple packages for people traveling 
from Canada to Havana. In fact, if you book within 
the next week, I can offer you a round-trip flight 
and five nights in an all-inclusive hotel for around 
$1,500 per person.
M:  That would be perfect. While we’re in Cuba, we’d 
also like to tour Zapata National Park and scuba 
dive at one of the nearby reefs. Would you be able 
to book those activities for us?
W:  For a small fee, yes. But I recommend booking 
your flights and accommodations now over the 
phone and then visiting our Web site to get a 
better idea of the activities available through our 
partner tour companies.

W:  Ms. Akita wants you to organize the company’s 
annual holiday party. Since you’ve successfully 
planned the event in the past, she feels like you’re 
best suited to do it this year.
M:  OK. However, did Ms. Akita say anything about 
catering? Although the entrées we’ve gotten from 
Greek Sisters on previous occasions have gone 
over well, the restaurant closed down. I’m not sure 
if Ms. Akita has an opinion on where we should 
source the food for the party.
W:  She didn’t mention a specific company, but she 
wants you to make sure that employees’ taste 
preferences are taken into account. So, please 
take a few minutes now to e-mail staff and find out 
what they’d like to have as well as whether any 
food allergies need to be taken into account. We’ll 
use their feedback to pick an appropriate caterer. 
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
W:  It has been a long time since I’ve participated in a 
continued education course, and I need to learn 
about recent trends in Web site design. Would you 
care to take a class with me? 
M:  I would. I actually talked about this topic with 
some of our colleagues the other day, and they 
said the Grey Institute provides good training in 
computer-based design. Plus, the institute’s main 
campus is located near our workplace. 
Registration for a July Web developer course is 
open until this Friday.
W:  Oh, that’s perfect timing. But before signing up, 
one of us had better inquire whether the July class 
meets our skill level. 
M:  To my knowledge, it’s for advanced students, so I 
think it does. But I can call the institute during my 
lunch break to find out. 
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Good morning. I just opened an office for my 
accounting firm at 209 Randall Drive in Kingfield, 
and I need my business’s garbage and recycling 
to be disposed of weekly. I’m contacting your trash 
collection company because it’s very well reviewed 
on blogs by past and current customers alike. 
M:  We appreciate your interest in TriStar Collection. 
Due to city zoning laws, however, we are prohibited 
from operating in Kingfield and only send our 
trucks to the Lott and Edina neighborhoods at this 
time. I apologize for the inconvenience and 
encourage you to get in touch with Henderson 
Garbage, as they are now contracted to serve 
Kingfield.
W:  I recall reading positive reviews about that 
business too, so I’ll definitely contact them. 
Thanks for the information, and have a nice rest of 
the day. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  I think we have a problem. Our warehouse 
manager says that there’s insufficient stock to fill 
all the orders we received at the trade fair last 
week. We need 250 more D90 office scanners 
than we have access to.
W:  Hmm. Have you reached out to our distributor to 
see whether we can get another shipment on 
short notice?
M:  That’s unfortunately not a viable option. Melissa 
Dover, who manages inventory for Mavis 
Distribution, told me that her company couldn’t 
handle the order at the moment, though she didn’t 
specify why. 
W:  I see. Well, maybe we should purchase some

clients.
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  There has apparently been an accident in the 
cafeteria. One of the grade school students 
tripped and spilled her tray on the floor. I don’t 
think anyone was hurt, but the mess needs to be 
cleaned as soon as possible. Can you go and 
mop it up? The equipment you’ll need is in the 
storage closet.
W:  Sorry, but I already logged out and am about to 
head home for the day. However, Patrick arrived 
about 15 minutes ago and is most likely free to 
handle the situation. You should radio him.
M:  He’s in the gymnasium right now helping set up 
for this afternoon’s school assembly. The 
preparations are coming along slowly, so he 
probably can’t break away from that right now.  
I suppose I can just hold off on sweeping the 
locker rooms and take care of it myself. 
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  I connected with a factory in China that’s able to 
manufacture our products at the price per unit that 
we’ve requested. The owner of the plant also told 
me that he has a strong relationship with a 
shipping company and could get us a cost-
effective rate to transport the finished goods to the 
United States. 
M:  Excellent. And did you explain that I’d want to see 
the facility in person prior to hiring them? I’ll need 
to inspect its quality control process as I’ve done 
for our partners in Mexico and Thailand in the 
past. 
W:  I did, and it won’t be an issue. He said you’re 
welcome to travel there at your convenience. 
M:  OK. I’ll have my assistant coordinate with him 
about dates.

Hello, Daniel. This is Catherine from Lamps and 
Lighting. As you know, we are very pleased with the 
logo and posters that you created for us earlier in the 
year. Because our experiences with you have been 
so positive, we’d like to hire you to design an eight-
page brochure for our shop to showcase some of the 
items we sell. However, the handout has to be ready 
in only two weeks from now, so you wouldn’t have 
much time to work on it. Could you let me know 
whether you’re available? And if so, please tell me 
how much the brochure will cost to be made. Thank 
you!
Questions 74-76 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting.
미국식	발음
I’ve arranged this meeting to discuss our company’s 
health benefits. Effective this November, employees 
will be required to cover part of the expense of their 
health insurance plans. The amount that you’ll need 
to pay will depend on your specific insurance policy, 
but people with high-deductible family plans may 
have to contribute up to 20 percent of their monthly 
premiums. So, I encourage everyone to review the 
available plans to see whether sticking with your 
current ones will be economically feasible. You can 
do so by skimming through one of the informational 
healthcare packets on this table. I understand that 
this may not come as welcome news, but it’s a 
necessary change. Given our decreased profits this 
year, the company can’t afford to continue offering full 
coverage. 
Questions 77-79 refer to the following announcement.

Attention all Phantom Land visitors. It is now 10 p.m. 
The park will be closing in 30 minutes, which means 
that rides and arcade games will cease operating at 
10:20. We encourage everyone to begin exiting the 
park. Please remember to take your belongings with 
you when leaving, including possessions stored in the 
lockers located near the ticketing booth. Moreover, all 
wheelchairs and rental strollers must be completely 
cleaned out and dropped off at the front desk. As a 
reminder, the South Gate has been temporarily roped 
off for renovations, so direct access to the Orange Lot 
parking area is only available through the East Gate. 
Finally, please note that guests will not be permitted 
back into Phantom Land once they have left.

Thousands of people are expected to flock to Elk 
Lake this weekend for the first-ever Spencer Fishing 
Tournament. The contest begins tomorrow at 7 a.m. 
and is set to attract professional and amateur 
participants from around the country. Spencer 
Incorporated is serving as the corporate sponsor for 
the event and will be presenting the winner with a 
brand new Starline EZ fishing boat, while the 
contestants who achieve second and third place will 
receive professional fishing poles and accessories. 
Anyone who intends to head to Elk Lake tomorrow is 
warned that the nearby subway station is currently 
under construction. So, event participants are only 
able to reach the venue by car or public bus, which 
will most likely lead to roadway congestion.

As some of you already know, our firm has been 
asked to do a fashion show in February as part of the 
Rosebury Mall’s Winter Fundraiser. Eighty percent of 
the proceeds from the event will be donated to Power 
First, a local charity that is dedicated to working with 
disadvantaged youth. As it is already mid-December, 
we need to start making preparations for the 
collections that we intend to display at the show. 
Following this meeting, I’d like each of you to choose 
your two favorite outfits from our line that was 
commercially released in November. Then, I’ll look 
over your choices this afternoon and decide whether 
they should be altered at all for the runway.

Hi, Ms. Bloom. This is Walter Treadle from Jiffy Brick 
and Mortar. I got your message about your chimney 
and want to answer some of your questions. First, we 
do both fireplace restoration and chimney repairs. Our 
standard rate for restoration services is $300, 
assuming that the original brickwork is in reasonable 
condition. As far as repair costs are concerned, the 
figures depend on the amount of work required. 
However, we generally charge $100 per hour for 
simple tasks such as patching exterior cracks. But 
extensive damage can cost up to $4,000 to fix. Until 
your property is thoroughly inspected, I won’t be able 
to give you a precise quote.

Good afternoon, Pamela. It’s Alicia Emerson calling. 
This message is about the wireless keyboard 
prototype that you made. Overall, the physical model 
of the device is very nice. It’s properly sized, quite 
lightweight, and feels comfortable to use with two 
hands. My primary concern has to do with the actual 
keys. They seem to be a bit narrow and stick out too 
far from the base, causing my fingers to scrape on the 
keys’ edges from time to time. Also, I think the 
keyboard ought to have backlight functionality, as it 
would make typing in dim environments much easier. 
Please address these issues during the next round of 
modifications. Once you’ve done so, please send the 
new prototype back to me so that I can look over it 
once more.

I’d like to go over a few basic payroll protocols with 
you all while I have your attention. To begin with, 
please make sure that you fill out your time sheets 
and send them to the accounting department every 
day. The departmental e-mail address is included on 
Page 12 of your employee handbook. Staff members 
should also try to submit daily reports prior to the end 
of their shifts. It’s OK if they’re received by the next 
day on occasion, but turning them in any later will be 
reflected in your annual evaluations. Also, be 
reminded that supervisors must formally agree to all 
overtime work in order for employees to qualify for 
time and a half. Anyone who works overtime without 
the required approval will be paid their usual hourly 
wage.
