Questions 141-143 refer to the following article. 
The Hazards of Stress 
You may eat the right food and get plenty of sleep and 
exercise, but what are you doing about stress? Texas 
University research psychologist Dr. Anne Warnock,

human immune system, has found that stress may 
have a _________ impact on the body's ability to heal  
141. (A) direct 
(B) director 
(C) directed 
(D) directly 
itself. In just one of several studies, Dr. Warnock 
selected 60 nursing professionals who regularly 
experienced stress and injected their bodies with a 
mild form of the flu virus. She then compared the 
numbers of antibodies their immune systems 
produced to those produced by another group of 
people who experienced little to no stress at all. Of the 
two groups, nearly all of the nurses reacted poorly to 
the flu virus, __________ most in the relaxed group  
142.  (A) because 
(B) however 
(C) whereas 
(D) moreover 
reacted normally. This led Dr. Warnock to conclude 
that frequent stress weakens the immune system, 
leaving a stressed person's body vulnerable to even 
minor ____________ that most people would be  
143.  (A) injuries 
(B) illnesses 
(C) adjustments 
(D) differences 
able to handle with ease.

147. (A) follow 
(B) will follow 
(C) to follow

148.  (A) article 
(B) debate 
(C) content 
(D) comment 
However, I must protest at a recent choice of guest in 
Ms. Kathleen Pineda. The opinions that she expressed 
regarding the Public Broadcast Network's supposed 
liberal bias are completely without basis and actually 
reflect her own narrow view of the spectrum of 
modern society. I will grant that Ms. Pineda's views are 
provocative. However, they are clearly meant to 
_____________ an emotional reaction rather than add 
149.  (A) cause 
(B) relieve 
(C) avoid 
(D) expand 
anything useful to what should be a thoughtful 
analysis of the issues at hand. In fact, I find her utter 
disregard for facts to be particularly offensive to 
viewers like myself. Surely, you can do better. 
Sincerely, 
Marcia Hastings
