Questions 71 through 73 refer to the following excerpt from a meeting. 
(Man) Everyone, please listen carefully to the new rule regarding work time. In the past, the administration has 
been pretty flexible, allowing people to arrive a bit late in the mornings as long as they made up the time later. 
I’ve talked with the managers and together we decided that we have to change this system. There have been too 
many cases where people took advantage of the situation. Look at it this way. Since we want our company to be 
known for its reliability and consistency, it’s essential to develop those qualities in our staff. So, beginning on 
Monday, employees will sign in to an online time-tracking program. There’ll be an e-mail with further instructions 
about it. 
71. What is the main purpose of the talk? 
(A) To set a new working schedule 
(B) To explain how to use a program 
(C) To warn staff against being late 
(D) To announce a change of system  
72. What does the man mean when he says, “Look at it this way”? 
(A) He will state a point of view.  
(B) He hopes no one disagrees. 
(C) He is giving driving directions. 
(D) He wants people to pay attention.

Questions 150-153 refer to the following article. 
Gardenville to Resurrect Jefferson Cinema 
Gardenville City Council members voted on Thursday to proceed with the restructuring and 
renovation of the old Jefferson Cinema on Jorgensen Street. The structure, built in the late 1920s, 
has sat vacant since it shut down in the 1980s. The opening of two multiplex theater complexes in 
Gardenville drove the one-screen cinema out of business.  
Upon recommendation of the Gardenville Arts Council (GAC) and the Gardenville History Society, 
the city will invest a sum of $2.3 million in the building. The updated facility will be used as a 
venue for live theatrical performances and will be renamed The Jefferson Playhouse. Local theater 
group Flora-Lane Community Players will use the building for all its rehearsals and shows. Likewise, 
the venue will also be a space for visiting acts, performers, and theatrical groups. GAC President 
Marvin Lee said in a telephone interview “we are thrilled that the council approved the project 
unanimously. ---[1]---. First, it will help preserve our local heritage and history, and it will also 
provide our community’s theater club with a more appropriate home.” ---[2]---. Flora-Lane 
Community Players currently practices and holds performances at the Carter Neighborhood Youth 
Center’s auditorium. ---[3]---.However, with a seating capacity of only 100 audience members, the 
group’s growingly popular shows require a larger venue. ---[4]---. 
The project is scheduled to begin on June 8 and will last for approximately four months.  
150. Why did council members decide to go ahead with the project? 
(A) They were suggested to do so by two local organizations.  
(B) They hope to create more town employment opportunities. 
(C) They were asked by a theater group to provide a larger venue. 
(D) They consider the youth center to be severely outdated. 
151. The word “drove” in paragraph 1, line 4, is closest in meaning to 
(A) transported 
(B) motivated 
(C) energized 
(D) forced
