Questions 150-152 refer to the following e-mail. 
Canada’s Up-and-Coming Tech Center 
Kitchener is one of Canada’s largest cities but has mainly been 
known as an industrial center. However, this has been 
changing in recent years, thanks to an increased number of 
computer start-up companies  
------- computers in the area as well, mainly due to the 
proximity of materials necessary for production. 
150. (A) assembly 
(B) assembled 
(C) assembling 
(D) assemblage 
This gradual shift is somewhat predictable, though, since 
Kitchener has several advantages for developing tech 
businesses. 
First, it is near one of the largest cities in Canada, Toronto, 
which is well-known for great shopping and entertainment, 
among other things. On the other hand, it is far enough away 
that many things are more ------- compared to those in Toronto. 
In fact, people relocating to Kitchener can expect to pay less 
for most daily needs, from housing to food to public 
transportation.  
151. (A) sensible 
(B) practical 
(C) reasonable 
(D) convenient 
These elements could have a transformative effect, changing 
the city from an industrial to a technology center. And, while 
such rapid growth may eventually prove the city’s downfall—as 
it increases in size, it likely ------- the qualities that made it 
attractive in the first place—for now, residents are enjoying the 
possibilities before them. 
152. (A) lost 
(B) has lost 
(C) is losing 
(D) will lose
