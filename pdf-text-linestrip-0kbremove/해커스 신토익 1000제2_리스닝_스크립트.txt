Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hello. My name is Vanessa Johnson, and I’m 
calling because I want to report an error in your 
newspaper.
M:  What mistake did you discover, Ms. Johnson?
W:  Well . . . I’m the owner of the vitamin and 
supplement store called Lancaster Health and 
Nutrition. Yesterday, you published an article 
about our new branch that’s going to open in 
Dalton Plaza next week. But the article said it’s 
opening next month.
M:  Oh, I’m very sorry. I’ll be certain to notify our news 
editor immediately. Once he verifies the misprint, 
I’m sure he’ll arrange for a correction to be posted 
in tomorrow’s edition.
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  It appears that we need more meals for tonight’s  
year-end corporate dinner party. Seven of our 
employees brought additional guests, but the 
cooks only prepared enough food for the confirmed 
number of guests.  
M:  Hmm, that’s odd. I was in charge of keeping track of 
the guest list, and just one person contacted me 
today to say that he was bringing an extra person 
with him.
W:  Maybe some of them changed their minds at the 
last minute. Anyway, could you ask the chef to 
make a few more dishes?
M:  Sure. I’ll head to the kitchen and find out if he can 
do that. 
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음	 	
M:  Shannon, I noticed that you ride your bike to work. 
Did you know that some of the people in our 
department have formed a bicycle group? 
W:  Really? I hadn’t heard that. Can you tell me more 
about it?
M:  Well, we meet every Saturday and go on long 
rides together. Some of us just enjoy the workout, 
while others are training for competitive events. Of 
course, participating in races isn’t a requirement 
for biking with us.
W:  Great! I was a bit concerned. As I’m not a very 
experienced rider, I’m not interested in competing. 
But I do like the idea of getting some exercise. How 
do I join?
M:  I’ll e-mail you the registration form this afternoon.
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  After this morning’s new recruit orientation, you said 
that you’d provide me with a list of the names of the 
new employees from each department. But the one 
you sent me was from the last orientation instead. 
W:  Sorry about that. Is it OK if I get you the correct one 
later? I must go to an important lunch meeting with 
the funders of our new building project right now, so 
I don’t have enough time at the moment.
M:  That’s fine. Just remember to get it to me before 
you leave the office today. I’ll need to enter  
their contact information into our database before I 
publish the new employee directory on Wednesday. 
W:  I won’t forget.
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  You want to see me, Ms. Collins?
W:  Yes. Many customers have provided negative 
feedback about the XLNC solar clocks. I’m a little 
worried. They say their machines aren’t charging 
properly, which causes them to stop functioning 
after just a few days.
M:  Bill Johnson from our engineering team and I 
recently tested 200 random units. They all worked 
perfectly. So, my guess is that consumers aren’t 
using the devices properly. I think we need to 
clarify our user manual.
W:  I see. We should also post information about it on 
our Web site. Can you please make a draft of that?
M:  OK. When do you want this done by?
W:  Early enough so that I can skim through it before 
my shift ends today.
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Excuse me. I’d like some assistance. I need to 
have 100 wedding invitations printed, but I’m not 
sure which type of paper to use. I want the 
invitations to look nice but also be durable. Do you 
have any recommendations?
W:  I suggest trying our store’s glossy card stock. This 
high-quality paper is very strong, so it doesn’t tear 
easily. It’d be ideal if you intend to deliver the 
invitations through the mail. 
M:  That sounds perfect. How much will the order 
cost? 
W:  Well, each sheet of card stock costs 50¢ to print,

Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  Hello. I read about the fitness courses your 
business offers in a flyer. I’m interested in the 
weight training class. When is it held?
W:  That one is held once a week on Saturday, from 9 
a.m. to 1 p.m. in our largest room. We used to offer 
a second session at 7 p.m., but not many people 
signed up, so we decided to cancel it.
M:  Oh, that’s OK. I wasn’t planning on coming in then, 
anyway. The earlier option should work for me. 
So, I’d like to know a bit more about the details of 
the session. 
W:  Would you like me to grab you an informational 
pamphlet? It’ll explain everything you need to 
know.
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:   Excuse me. I’ve come to your office because I 
received a service request from Sarah Long.
W1:  Yes. Um . . . her desk is next to mine. Sarah, the 
repairperson from Raymond is here to fix the 
water cooler.
W2:  Oh, sorry. I was just finishing up a conference 
call. Anyway, the cooler is right here behind my 
desk.
M:   Water is leaking from the device’s spout, right?
W2:  Yeah. I noticed it dripping this morning. 
M:   Hmm . . . the spout isn’t working correctly and 
needs to be replaced. 
W2:  OK. However, before you begin, I’ve got to notify 
the building manager that a repair is going to be 
made. Janice, what is Mr. Renner’s extension?
W1:  It’s 6849. I’ll call him and tell him for you.
W2:  Great. I appreciate it.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	
W:  Hello. My name is Annabel Christiansen. I’m here 
to check in for the 5:40 p.m. flight to London. I have 
my passport and ticket here.
M:  I’m sorry. You’ve arrived too late, Ms. Christiansen. 
Check-in for that flight closed 20 minutes ago. 
There won’t be enough time for you to reach the 
gate before takeoff.
W:  Oh, no. I was worried this was going to happen, 
seeing as my taxi was stuck in traffic on the way 
here. Are there any other flights today that I can 
take instead?
M:  Yes, we still have seats available on the one that 
leaves at 10:30 p.m. For a $100 fee, I can update 
your reservation and issue you another ticket.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hi, Nicholas. I thought you were supposed to leave 
for Toronto on Monday to get together with some 
prospective clients. Are you no longer going?
M:  I still am, but I had to postpone my departure on 
short notice. Now I’ll be leaving on Friday evening 
and coming back next Tuesday. 
W:  Oh, no! That can’t be good for a first meeting. 
How’d your clients react? Clients usually don’t like 
last minute changes like that.
M:  I explained to them that a problem arose with 
another advertising campaign. I told them I needed 
to be here to help resolve it before tomorrow’s 
deadline. Fortunately, they said it wasn’t an issue.

캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Hello, Ms. Law. My name is Lance Graner, and I 
am organizing a conference in April for young 
professionals who are just entering the field of 
finance. As you are an investment consultant for a 
respected firm, I am calling to offer you a paid 
speaking opportunity at the conference.
W:  Well, I’ll be unavailable in early April, as I’m 
planning to visit one of our offices abroad during 
that time. However, as long as the event takes 
place after April 15, I can participate.
M:  Hmm . . . Never mind then. It’ll likely occur on April 
4. But I’ll contact you if we have other speaking 
opportunities in the future.

and program.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  The opening week of the restaurant was rather 
successful, wouldn’t you say?
W:  Absolutely. We exceeded our expected guest 
numbers, and the restaurant was fully booked last 
weekend. 
M:  Yeah. And many of the people who came said they 
were going to post about our restaurant on their 
social networking pages. That’s great publicity.
W:  Also, our publicist, Harold Newman, will be 
appearing on Morning Buzz tomorrow. That will be 
sure to build even more positive public attention 
for us.
M:  Really? I heard that he was going to be on Mornings 
with Jerry.
W:  No. He is only scheduled for one program. Our 
manager will appear on the show you mentioned.

M:  Ms. Barton, I’m done measuring the existing 
windows in your home. Now, let’s look at some 
options for new ones.
W:  Well, I’m quite fond of these windows with awnings. 
Would it be possible to have those installed?
M:  Sure. Um, given the size of the space, it would 
cost approximately $300 to purchase the windows 
and have them installed. That’s just an estimate, 
of course.
W:  OK. I also have a coupon for 20 percent off for 
first-time customers. Will that be applicable?
M:  I’m sorry, but that promotion isn’t . . . um . . . it isn’t

Good afternoon, Mr. Jackson. This is Claudia Omar,

everyone a tutorial this afternoon. You won’t need to

leadership, the company grew to be the world’s third-
largest software developer, and it now employs over 
15,000 staff members. According to industry insiders, a 
replacement has already been selected. While Core 
Resources has yet to release the person’s name to the 
public—and most likely won’t do so until closer to Ms. 
Rose’s departure—some analysts are speculating 
about who the next leader of the company might be.

Stay tuned for Carl Lewis’ Daily Business Report. 
Joining Carl tonight for a rare television interview will 
be Francine Austen. She is the managing editor of the 
fashion and design publication Currents. They’re 
going to talk about the online version of the magazine 
that was launched earlier this year. It has proven to be 
very successful, as the number of new subscribers to 
Currents increased for two consecutive months after 
the site became active. This success is attributed to 
Ms. Austen’s development of a subscription model 
that provides access to the print and digital versions 
for one low fee. They’ll discuss this in depth when we 
return from a short commercial break.
Questions 95-97 refer to the following talk and map.

OK . . . We’re ready to begin our tour of Westfield 
Botanical Park. But first, I’d like to apologize for the 
delay. The tour bus that will be transporting our group 
had an engine problem, but it is operational now. 
Please turn your attention to the map in the brochure 
you received earlier, and I will go over our route. We’ll 
follow the main road from here at the visitors center 
and go past the lily pond and visit the orchid house 
and the bamboo jungle. Since we won’t have time to 
visit both of the remaining attractions today, we’ll take 
the most direct way back to the visitors center. When 
we reach the center, we’ll provide each of you with a 
complimentary gift from our gift shop to express our 
appreciation for your patience. Now, let’s begin.
Questions 98-100 refer to the following telephone 
message and schedule.

Hello. My name is Alice Warren, and I’m registered for 
the student employment workshop that will be held at 
the Westwood Employment Center on Saturday. I’m 
very excited about this because I plan to begin 
searching for a summer internship in early May, once 
I’ve finished my final exams at the end of April. But 
there’s one problem . . . I have to meet with my 
professor to discuss an assignment that day. Um, it 
slipped my mind when I signed up for the workshop 
yesterday. Would it be a problem if I skipped one of 
the sessions? I would leave at noon and be back just 
after two. Please call me at 555-4938 to let me know if 
this is allowed. Thanks.

캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Welcome to the Excel Corporate Charity Event. If 
you tell me your full name and the company you 
are affiliated with, I can let you know which seat 
you have been assigned to. 
W:  My name is Prema Khan, and I’m representing my 
investment firm, Mumbai International. But before I 
find my seat, is there a place where I can hang my 
coat? I’d rather not keep it with me all night.  
M:  First, let me lead you to your table. Then, I would 
be happy to check your coat for you. 
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers. 
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:    Hey, Mark and Floyd. Did you guys see the 
memo about the upcoming changes to the travel 
expense policy?
M1:  Yes, Samantha. I’m glad the company has 
decided to increase the amount that employees 
will be reimbursed for transportation to $5,000 
per trip.
M2:  That’ll really help when booking flights for 
business trips.
W:   Don’t you think it’s a bit high? On my last business 
trip, I didn’t spend more than $1,600 for all my 
travel expenses.
M1:  Sure . . . but your team members don’t have to 
travel internationally.
M2:  Exactly. Members of the technology team, like 
Floyd and I, go abroad frequently to complete 
projects.
W:    Oh, right. I forgot that your department is putting 
in  the computer  system for  one of  our 
international partners’ new headquarters. 
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Ms. Ellison, is it possible for us to get new 
computer monitors for the office? The graphic 
designers say the resolution quality of our current 
computer screens is rather poor. It seems to 
negatively impact their work. 
W:  I’ve been meaning to do that for quite a while. We 
couldn’t afford to upgrade in the past, but we have 
enough funds this month. I’ll ask the office 
manager to order high-resolution monitors for all 
our designers. 
M:  They will certainly appreciate that. And if you’re 
unsure about which models to get, I can ask the 
staff for their opinions on the matter.
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hi, Adrian. I need to talk to you about our plans for 
tomorrow. I know I offered to drive us to the 
amusement park in the morning, but I don’t think 
I’ll be able to. For some reason, my car won’t start. 
I’m going to have it towed to a repair center to be 
fixed. 
M:  That’s OK. Rachel should still have room in her 
van, so I’m sure we can ride with her instead. 
W:  Great. Do you think she will also be able to pick me 
up from my house? Since I won’t have a vehicle, it 
will be hard for me to meet up with everyone. 
M:  I don’t think she’ll mind, but I’ll ask her anyway. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Beth . . . I’m glad I caught you. Our company is 
designing Fieldstone Incorporated’s new Portland 
of f ice,  so I ’m meet ing wi th one of  thei r 
representatives next week to discuss the project 
time table. I’d like you to join me.
W:  OK. I heard about the new contract, but I didn’t 
know I’d be involved. I assume you’re going to be 
running the project, right?
M:  I’m helping out during the early stages. As Jenna 
Adams is the team leader, I won’t really have a 
supervisory role.
W:  This is going to be her first time in a management 
role, isn’t it?
M:  Yes. But she has worked on similar projects in the 
past, so I’m confident that she will do well.
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hey, Larry. How are things going here at the 
ticketing office? I just want to check and see if the 
new software we installed is working OK.
M:  Oh, it’s been wonderful! It is easy to use and 
saves a lot of time. I’ve been able to serve twice 
as many customers as usual this morning.
W:  That’s good news. I was hoping it would make 
your job easier. Do you think any other agents will 
need training on how to use it?
M:  Yes. Two new employees are starting next week, 
so I’ll have to provide them with some instructions.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Welcome to Prim Hair. Do you have an appointment 
with one of our stylists today? 
W:  Oh, I’ve stopped in to view your selection of 
merchandise. I use Nature’s Touch shampoo and 
was told that you carry the brand. If so, I’d like to 
buy some. 
M:  Yes, we do. Also, we’re having a promotion on 
that brand this week, so everything from that line

영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  I just went through the income statement prepared 
by the accounting team. I’m a little concerned 
because sales have declined at many of the 
cosmetics stores we operate. 
M:  I know. Apparently, our main competitor now 
offers an online service. Customers can order 
products through the company’s Web site and 
have them delivered on the same day.
W:  That is a lot more convenient than visiting one of 
our shops in person.
M:  That’s what I’m getting at. We need to figure out a 
way to be more competitive.
W:  Well, the solution seems obvious . . . We should 
develop a similar service.
M:  Yeah. I’m going to put together a presentation 
about this for the CEO.

M:  Hi, Brenda. Do you have any plans for this 
Saturday? I was hoping to go to the opening of a 
photo exhibit at Mendez Gallery with some other 
members from our department. Would you like to 
come with us?
W:  Thanks for the invitation. I was supposed to meet 
my friend Peter, but he called and said he couldn’t 
make it due to a family obligation. So, I’d be happy 
to come with you to the exhibit instead.
M:  Wonderful! I’m sure you’ll like the nature and 
landscape pictures at the gallery. By the way, 
we’re thinking of having lunch at a café in the area 
before going to the gallery. You are more than 
welcome to join us.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.

M:  Hello, this is Joshua Curtis from Ridley Institute. 
We were supposed to receive a piece of specialty 
laboratory equipment from your store last Friday, 
but it wasn’t delivered.
W:  Oh, I apologize for that. Your item was most likely 
included in the recent shipment, which was 
delayed due to bad weather. Now that weather 
conditions have improved, your order will be 
mailed out today.
M:  I hope I get the machine soon, because we’ll need 
it for our next research project. Do you know when 
the shipment will arrive here?
W:  It should take about three to five business days. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation

미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Jonathan, have you found a place to order a cake 
from for our company’s 10th anniversary dinner?
M:  I want to use Norman’s Bakery again this time. It 
usually does a stellar job and it’s . . . uh . . . right 
next to Marshall Park.
W:  That’s true, but they don’t offer any gluten-free 
options, which several staff members require. 
What about Medley Cakes?
M:  Haven’t you heard? Medley Cakes closed last 
month. A new bakery called French Delights took 
over that location. 
W:  Hmm . . . I guess we’ll have to use Katy’s 
Confections. It’s quite expensive, though.
M:  Actually, someone mentioned that a new vegan, 
gluten-free bakery had opened across from where 
Medley Cakes used to be. I’ll try to get in touch 
with them.
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and table.

M:  Hello. I’m interested in taking your center’s 
ceramics course. I filled out the registration form 
ahead of time and brought it with me today.
W:  Great. I’ll take the form and get you registered. So, 
you’d . . . ah . . . you’d prefer the Thursday night 
class. Unfortunately, that class is full.
M:  I see. Well, I’ll register for another day in the 
evening, then. I need to take the class at night, 
since I work until 7 p.m. every day.
W:  OK. You’re signed up for the day and time I’ve 
circled on this table. If you don’t know where the 
class is being held, I can give you a map showing 
that as well. 
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation 
and bar graph.

M:  We really need to hurry up and finish this sales 
report so we can make it to today’s off-site training 
workshop in time. It starts in just 30 minutes.
W:  Don’t worry. We have just a few more things to do. 
We’ve still got to indicate that October was when 
revenues were the lowest.
M:  Are you sure? I think the month before we held the 
promotional event for our EC tablet was when 
sales were the poorest. 
W:  Oh, you’re right. Let me fix that on the graph. OK. 
Done.
M:  Great. Now, we just need to wrap up the typed 
summary. Do you think we can do that within a 
half hour?
W:  Should be possible. I have the template from last 
month’s report that we can use as a reference.

message.
미국식	발음	
Hello, this is Jamie Foster at Phoenix Merchandising. 
This message is for Ms. Helen Rohan. I need to inform 
you that the specific model of VelociClean vacuum 
cleaner that you ordered is out of stock. However, we 
do have something similar called the Weyden Platinum. 
It is lightweight and removes more dirt from carpets 
than other models. Because of its design, it’s easy to 
control and move around any indoor space. And since

Good evening, Ms. Jameson. This is Richard Powell 
calling from Smithson & Howard. As you already know, 
we are supposed to meet at your office this afternoon 
to review design plans that my firm created for your 
new home. However, an emergency meeting has come 
up, which I must go to at 1 p.m. Consequently, I can’t 
visit you today but will be sending a colleague of mine, 
Lori Fielding, to take my place. She’s very familiar with 
the plans for your house and can answer any questions 
that you may have. I apologize for the inconvenience 
and appreciate your understanding.

This is Patrick West reporting live for WRRE 
Eyewitness News. I’m here at West Wellington Park, 
and we’ve got warmer than usual temperatures, a 
nice breeze, and clear skies again on the last day of 
the annual Cherry Festival, so come on down. There’s 
something for everyone. Kids will enjoy the exciting 
rides and games, parents will appreciate the musical 
and cultural shows, and both will love the delicious 
food being served by the many booths set up here. 
The festival will end tonight after the 8 p.m. Mississippi 
Mounds concert. I’ll be joined by the event organizer 
after a short commercial break, so be sure to stay 
tuned.

Hello, everyone. It’s a pleasure to have you all here at 
The Culinary House. Today, you will be learning how to 
make homemade pizza. This will be the first of three 
dishes that you’re going to make. I’ve already set 
printed booklets on the counters containing all of the 
recipes that you’ll need this morning. Please take them 
out and open up to the recipe on the second page. 
Before you start cooking this meal, however, you all 
need to break up into pairs. Since there aren’t enough 
utensils for each student, everyone will have to find 
someone else to work with.

Hello, Zack. My name is Allison Peng, and I’m calling 
from Creative Prime Agency. I’ve contacted several 
galleries in the Richmond area about your work and 
heard back from Electric Space downtown. The 
curator from that gallery expressed great interest in 
the contemporary paintings you created and said 
she’d be delighted to exhibit them there in October. 
Electric Space’s art gallery is a newly renovated 
building with ample space for your large-scale 
landscapes. It’s hard to imagine a better choice. So, 
please let me know if you’d like to take advantage of 
this wonderful opportunity.

May I have your attention, please? An inspector from 
the Federal Department of Safety will be visiting our 
plant next Friday, the 12th. I just want to remind you all 
of a few things. First, because the inspector will 
examine each work area, you all must ensure that our 
safety equipment is in good condition. Following this 
meeting, I will hand out lists of things to check. Please 
fill these out and hand them in to your supervisor by the 
end of the day. Also, there will be a short meeting at 3 
o’clock for all departmental managers. Since the 
conference room has been reserved already, we’ll 
gather in my office. At that time, we will go over the 
entire schedule of events for the day the inspector visits 
our facility. OK, that’s all for now.

Today marks an important development for both 
Hanaway Industries and Glarris Technologies. Now 
that our two companies have combined to form 
Hanaway and Glarris Incorporated, we are the largest 
information technology firm in Europe. By consolidating 
our resources, we have positioned ourselves to serve 
clients more successfully than ever. This will surely be 
a benefit to our customers and the industry as a 
whole. However, we have a lot of work to do before 
we become fully operational. To that effect, employees 
from both of the formerly separate companies must 
continue to establish effective communication with 
each other in order to improve efficiency. That will be 
our primary focus over the next two months.
Questions 95-97 refer to the following telephone 
message and invoice.

Hello, Mr. Meade. This is Matthew from Bellville 
Interiors. I want to let you know that we’ll be able to 
put up the wallpaper in your new office next week on 
March 29 rather than April 3, as one of our current 
projects will end earlier than expected. You wanted us 
to start as soon as possible, so I assume this plan is 
acceptable, but . . . um, please call me back to let me 
know for sure. One more thing. I double-checked the 
measurements of your office, and it will actually take 
11 rolls of wallpaper to cover the walls. I’ll update the 
original invoice and send you a new copy this 
afternoon. The only change will be the additional 
charge of $38 . . . plus tax, of course.
Questions 98-100 refer to the following talk and graph.
영국식	발음
After reviewing last quarter’s financial reports, the CEO 
has decided that we need to reduce expenditures across 
the board. He asked that all employees come up with 
ways to cut their department’s expenses. So, it’s our 
responsibility to reduce spending in the marketing 
department. This is a priority, so you should postpone 
your other projects if necessary. There isn’t much we 
can do about the expense that accounts for the 
greatest share of our operating budget, but I guess we 
could try to reduce the next largest item by 20 percent. 
I have prepared an overview of our department’s 
monthly expenditures to help you with this task. Um, I’ll 
hand it out to everyone in a minute.

M:  My name is Brent Miller, and I placed an order late

up this afternoon. 
W:  Unfortunately not, Mr. Miller. I’m running behind 
schedule, so I’ve had to postpone working on your 
order until tomorrow afternoon. I apologize for the 
inconvenience. 
M:  That’s OK. I don’t need it until next week, so 
tomorrow is fine. I can stop by on my way home from 
work in the evening.

M:  I see that you’re looking at our store’s newest

them. 
W:  I’m interested in buying a speaker for my friend as 
a gift. He wants a portable one to connect to his 
cell phone. Do you have something matching that 
description? 
M:  I recommend the Tide EX. It’s designed specifically 
for cell phones. It’s lightweight and even has 
wireless capabilities. Plus, we are offering it at 10 
percent off the regular price this week.
W:  Thanks for the suggestion. I’ll go and take a look

W:  Hello, Hans. This is Karen. As you already know, 
Jim Bates is stepping down as head copywriter at 
the end of this month. That means we’ll have to 
move someone into his position. Who do you think 
would be a good candidate?
M:  Personally, I’m in favor of Richard Hammel. He’s 
been a dedicated employee for 10 years. He’s 
written the text for a variety of advertisements for 
us and seems to understand all aspects of the job. 
What do you think?
W:  I have several candidates in mind. Hammel is one of 
them. Can you meet me in the conference room in 
two hours? I’d like to talk about this matter further.
M:  Sure thing. See you then.

W1:  This is Emily Baker from Suite 324. I’d like to 
book one of the excursions listed in the resort

M:   Actually, I’m not supposed to . . . I’ll transfer you 
to our activities manager. She can help you out 
with that. 
W1:  No problem.
W2:  Hello, Ms. Baker. I’m Molly. Brian says you’d like 
to reserve an excursion. We offer a great variety of 
options such as tours of historic Holston City, 
guided hikes, and fishing trips.
W1:  I’m interested in the Holston City tour. However, 
while your brochure says groups leave daily at  
9 a.m., nothing is mentioned about when they 
return.
W2:  They get back around 3 p.m.
W1:  Perfect. Can you sign me up?

M:  Now that I’m in charge of the company’s occupational 
safety department, I’ve got to give a safety seminar

any instructional videos that I can use?
W:  Quite a few. What type of video do you want to 
show?
M:  One featuring precautionary measures at building 
sites.
W:  Oh, yeah. I bought a series of training videos last 
year. One of them deals with that topic. 
M:  It’d be great if you could send that one to me soon.
W:  They’re on my work computer, but the files are too 
large to e-mail. So I’ll post them on our online 
board for you to access.
M:  That works for me.

boxes of black pens. The respective item codes 
for the products I want are 34A and 77C. 
M:  I’ve got good news for you, Ms. White. Your order 
qualifies for the bulk rates that appear in our 
catalog. The folders are eligible for a 15 percent 
discount, and the pens are $30 off.
W:  Oh, great! I’ll be sure to tell my office manager. 
She’ll be pleased to know the purchase is costing 
us less than expected.

W:  Cliff, it’s Rita calling from Shine Realty. Has Unit 
219 been cleaned and repainted yet in preparation 
for the new renters? 
M:  I’m afraid it hasn’t. The property has been thoroughly 
cleaned, but one of our painters accidentally 
bought the wrong paint color. So, they aren’t able 
to paint the apartment yet.
W:  Well, the new tenants are moving in on April 1, 
which is only five days away. It’s essential that 
everything be taken care of before then.
M:  I spoke to the head painter this morning, and he 
assured me the apartment would be fully ready 
within the next three days. There shouldn’t be 
anything to worry about. 
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  Our company is releasing a new line of light bulbs 
next month. We’ve been assigned to create an 
advertising campaign slogan for it. Right now, I’m 
leaning towards the saying, “leading the way,” with 
the letters “l,” “e,” and “d” in bold to refer to our light-
emitting diode products pictured in the ads.  
W:  It’s short and clever, but I don’t think it highlights 
our product’s competitive attributes enough. Do 
you have any other ideas?
M:  I also came up with the slogan “bright lights, small 
impact” because our lights have less of a negative 
effect on the environment than regular light bulbs 
do.
W:  I think we should go with that slogan. Let’s bring it 
up to our supervisor at the staff meeting later 
today and see what his opinion is.

M:  Hi. The recreational baseball team that I play on 
needs a banner for an upcoming tournament. Here 
is what it should look like. 
W:  Let’s see . . . The Panthers? Wait, didn’t I make a 
banner for your team a few months ago . . . one 
with a blue and green stripe along the bottom?
M:  Yes. But last week there was a storm, and the 
banner was pulled off the fence by the wind. It has 
a big tear in it now.
W:  Oh, what a shame. I can have a new one ready by 
Friday. But, um, before you leave . . . Why don’t I 
show you how to securely attach a banner to a 
fence? That way you can avoid similar issues in 
the future.

호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	
M:  Jennifer, I’ve reviewed the product brochure draft 
for the trade show. It looks good on the whole, but 
I think we should slightly increase the size of our 
logo. It’s rather small compared to everything else, 
and I wanna make sure that it really stands out. 
W:  Certainly, Mr. Harris. That shouldn’t be difficult to 
fix. I can print out a copy of the updated brochure 
and bring it back to your office in about an hour. Is 
there anything else you want changed?
M:  No, I think that’s all. However, I have a doctor’s 
appointment just before lunchtime, so leave the 
brochure with my assistant. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M1:  Do you wanna join me this Friday for an event? 
Gallery Blue is holding a show of the latest work 
of sculptor Kerry Marx then.
M2:  Sure. I’m quite fond of her sculptures. When 
should we head there?
M1:  How does 7 p.m. sound? If you want, we can grab 
dinner beforehand as well.
M2:  That sounds good. Ellen, would you like to come, 
too?
W:   I can’t, since I’m busy Friday. However, I have a 
gift certificate for Harris Kitchen that I can give 
you. It expires on Saturday, so someone should 
use it.  
M1:  That’d be great, Ellen. Harris Kitchen is within the 
vicinity of the gallery.
W:   Wonderful. Well, I’ll get you the certificate tomorrow. 
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation

M:  Marie, an error was discovered on the time sheet 
you submitted last Thursday.
W:  Really? What seems to be the issue? 
M:  Wendy from the accounting department says you 
entered more than the maximum allowed hours 
per month.
W:  How odd. I’m fairly sure I wrote 200 hours on the 
sheet, but maybe I’m wrong. 
M:  Perhaps. Anyway, you’ll have to submit a revised 
timecard. Also, Wendy usually handles such 
information, but she and Robert are on a business 
trip together this week. So you should call the 
human resources manager to find out whom to 
submit the document to.
W:  All right. And sorry about the problem. I’ll be sure 
not to let it happen again.
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation

W:  Some of the crew leaders have been asking about 
when work on the stadium is set to begin, so they’ll 
be eager to learn more.
M:  Good. I’m also gonna bring up comments a recent 
client shared with us. Aside from cleanliness—
which I’ve already talked about to supervisors—
her feedback highlights a less-than-ideal aspect of 
our service that I need to talk about.
W:  OK. Well, I’ll post a memo about it this afternoon 
on our online board.
M:  Thanks. Oh . . . and please schedule the meeting 
for 4:15 p.m.

Questions 71-73 refer to the following radio broadcast.
영국식	발음		
This is Katie Jackson on T T Radio 96.1 FM, and it’s 
time for your morning traffic report. Drivers heading 
into the downtown area should take note that there is 
heavy traffic on the Bayport Bridge. There was a 
collision involving three cars approximately 20 
minutes ago at the south entrance to the bridge, 
resulting in the closure of two of the northbound lanes. 
Elsewhere, workers are conducting routine repair 
work on the Harborview Expressway, which is the 
other main road into the city’s business district. 
Motorists should expect delays of up to 40 minutes. 
Clearing these backups will take about two hours. In 
the meantime, it would be best to commute by subway 
this morning.
Questions 74-76 refer to the following announcement.

Welcome, everyone, to this orientation session for our

Hello, Ms. Hollandale. This is Shawn Reardon, your 
tax adviser, calling about your annual tax return. I was 
just going through the documents you provided, and I 
realized that some figures are missing. Specifically, I 
don’t have any information about the income you 
earned as a freelance photographer. These earnings 
obviously have to be included in your tax return. Could 
you please e-mail me copies of the receipts that you 
issued to your clients last year? I won’t be able to file 
your state and federal tax forms until you’ve done this. 
Thank you.

I want to express how much we at Green Renewal 
appreciate all of you donating your time and energy to 
help us remove waste from the grounds of Pine Park. 
Your task this morning is to walk around the park and 
pick up litter that accumulated throughout the winter. 
You’ll be doing this in groups of four, each of which 
will be assigned to a specific area. As you can see, 
the park is quite large. I expect today’s work to take at 
least four hours, so we’d better get started right away. 
If you all follow me to the van parked next to that row 
of flowers, I’ll give the necessary equipment to 
everyone.  
Questions 86-88 refer to the following report.

And now for business news . . . The Harvest 
Supermarkets chain has announced the acquisition of 
its rival, Atlantic Foods. Donald Parker, who 
established Harvest Supermarkets 12 years ago, 
assured consumers at a press conference this 
morning that the joining of the two companies would 
not result in less variety or higher prices. Harvest will 
retain Atlantic Foods’ most popular product lines and 
remains committed to giving its customers the best 
value for their money. Mr. Parker also stated that the 
deal would put his company in a position to compete 
with the national supermarket chains. Although time is 
required for consolidation, he plans on opening at 
least three stores later this year.

Questions 89-91 refer to the following excerpt from a 
meeting. 
호주식	발음
As you may have heard, our art center is planning to 
display some works by Oscar Juan. I expect the show 
will attract many potential buyers as well as some 
media attention. This is because Mr. Juan will be 
featured in an issue of a national art magazine that 
comes out on September 27, which is roughly one 
week before the exhibit here will begin. Um . . . the 
exhibition will run from October 3 to October 14. As 
this will be our center’s most important exhibit yet, it is 
crucial that everything goes smoothly. Our curator will 
now show us some slides of the paintings we will be 
displaying and provide some background information 
on each. This will hopefully give us some ideas about 
how to organize the exhibit. 
Questions 92-94 refer to the following telephone 
message and map.
영국식	발음
Hello, Mr. Chen. This is Karen calling from the Emerald 
Lodge regarding the reservation you made through our 
Web site. In your follow-up e-mail, you requested a 
room overlooking the pool area. Unfortunately, that 
entire wing will be unavailable to guests on the night 
you will be staying with us because it is being 
renovated. However, I could book you a larger room 
with a view of the ocean at no additional charge. Please 
call me back to let me know if this is acceptable. In 
addition, you inquired about arranging transportation 
from the airport. We have a shuttle bus that picks up 
passengers at the arrivals terminal. Um, it stops at the 
exit closest to the car rental center, directly opposite 
the taxi stand. Thank you.
Questions 95-97 refer to the following talk and graph.
호주식	발음
I have one more thing to discuss before we finish up 
today. As most of you know, the company’s latest 
refrigerator model has been very popular with 
consumers. Um, although sales revenues are still 
down a bit from earlier this year, we experienced our 
largest increase in the month of its launch. I met with 
some of the board members yesterday, and they 
expect the same level of success when we begin 
selling our new dishwasher in October. You know 
what that means . . . We’re going to have to develop 
an effective advertising strategy. So I’d like each of 
you to come up with one proposal to share with the 
other members of the team when we get together 
again on Friday. 
Questions 98-100 refer to the following telephone 
message and credit card statement.
캐나다식	발음
Good morning, Ms. Harkins. I’m Owen Connor from 
the accounting department. I need to speak to you 
about the charges you made to your company credit 
card in London last month. I believe you were 
participating in the product launch at the Riverside 
Electronics Exhibition. I received your e-mail with the 
scans of the statements for your airfare, meals, and 
accommodations, but there’s an issue with one of the 
transactions. It is company policy that staff can only 
charge a maximum of £30 per meal. It would probably 
be best if we talked about this in person rather than 
over the phone. Why don’t you stop by my office 
tomorrow morning? Say around eleven? Thanks.

Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Do you still want a larger desk and filing cabinet 
for your office? If so, you’re welcome to have my 
current ones. I’ll be transferring to another 
department at the end of the month and will no 
longer need them.
M:  I’ve wanted to replace mine for a while now, so I’d 
appreciate that. My only concern is that the desk 
might be too big for my workspace. Could you 
measure it today and let me know how large it is?
W:  Actually, I’m leaving for an appointment right now 
and won’t be back for the rest of the day. You are 
free to make the measurements, though. My office 
will be unlocked, so let yourself in any time.
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Over the last month, our boutique has only sold a 
few dresses from the Joyce Cho Collection. Since 
we have a limited amount of space in the store, we 
may want to consider replacing that line with items 
from other designers. 
W:  Yes, I know that it hasn’t been doing well, but I think 
that’s because it hasn’t been properly promoted. 
The clothes are actually very fashionable, so they 
should be more popular with our shoppers than 
they currently are.
M:  Then let’s try putting up a product display near the 
entrance to draw more attention to them. Could you 
work on a display plan when you finish writing the 
inventory list for the merchandise we received this 
morning?
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Excuse me. My friend and I would like to see 
tonight’s performance of Made for You. I’d like the 
closest seats to the stage.
W:  I’m very sorry, but it looks like you’re out of luck. A 
couple just got the final pair of tickets for this 
evening’s show.
M:  Is that so? I thought we were certain to get some 
given how early we arrived. 
W:  Yes, it’s a shame. However, I can reserve you 
some seats now for tomorrow’s performance if 
you’d like.
M:  Please do that. I leave town for a business 
conference the following day, so tomorrow will be 
my last chance to watch the play.
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  Next in line, please.
M:  Hello. I’m here to take a written exam and renew 
my driver’s license.
W:  OK. Just note that many people are ahead of you.
M:  Oh . . . If I stick around, when do you think I’d be 
able to take the test? I’m free for about an hour but 
need to leave for my work shift no later than 4 p.m. 
W:  Because of the number of people here, I doubt 
you’ll be finished by then. I suggest coming back 
on another day. Mornings are usually quite slow. 
That would probably be your best option. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Do you want to drive down to the medical 
conference with me this week? If we leave for San 
Francisco on Thursday morning, we’ll get there by 
early evening. That way, we can visit the Hill Art 
Museum on Friday morning before the conference. 
W:  That does sound like fun, but I think I will take the 
train. I heard on the news that there is major 
construction taking place on parts of the highway, 
and it is causing serious delays. 
M:  I didn’t know that. I should probably take the train 
too. I had better check if there are tickets still 
available. What time are you leaving?
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  I was trying to make a color copy of our new 
survey forms, but it seems the printer is out of ink. 
Do you know where we keep the cartridges?
M:  They’re usually in the storage cupboard in the staff 
room, but I think we’re out. I’m going to the office 
supply store after lunch, so I can get a case of 
them while I’m there.
W:  Perfect. Could you also pick up some additional 
things from the store? I’m running low on pens, 
folders, and a couple of other items.
M:  Sure. Just e-mail me a list of what you need within 
the next 30 minutes, and I’ll be sure to get 
everything for you.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Ms. Odessa, I heard that Flacco Incorporated will 
be buying out our firm. Do you know if that’s true? 
I haven’t received an official memo regarding the

It will be held this afternoon at 3 o’clock.

W:  Although we’ll have to wait to hear the final details 
from Mr. Hunter, I’ve been told that the acquisition 
will not result in staff layoffs. But he plans to 
answer staff’s questions at the meeting today. So, 
you can ask him directly at that time.

W:  The design department still hasn’t sent me a rough 
draft for our brochure. They were supposed to give 
it to me this morning so I could look over the 
design and see if everything is OK. 
M:  That’s strange. I thought that they had already 
finished working on that. Do you want me to drop 
by their offices and check on the status of their 
design?
W:  Could you? I’m really busy with another assignment 
right now, so I would really appreciate the help.
M:  No problem. I have to go up to their department 
anyway to deliver some updated employee 
manuals. I’ll head there in a couple of minutes.

M:  Hi, Alice. This is Tim calling from the warehouse. 
The air conditioner at our facility has stopped 
operating. It’s almost impossible to work in this 
heat. Could you send someone up to fix it?
W:  Yes, the facility manager and I were informed 
about that yesterday and sent a technician to 
check it out. He said the machine is old, and 
replacement parts are no longer available. So, we 
have ordered an entirely new machine. But 
unfortunately, you’ll have to deal with the heat for 
today, since it isn’t going to arrive until tomorrow. 
Sorry.
M:  Well, I suppose we will have to make do until then. 
Maybe I can find some fans to use in the meantime.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   Is everything ready for Mr. Henderson’s party on 
Friday? Having his accomplishments as a writer 
for the Boston Times recognized is a big honor, 
so I want everything to go smoothly for him.
W1:  Actually, we ran into an unforeseen problem. 
W2:  Yeah. The owner of Oakridge Restaurant just 
called to cancel our reservation.
M:   Really? Why?
W1:  The private room we reserved for Friday was 
accidentally double-booked. However, the owner 
said he would take 25 percent off our total bill if 
we decide to hold the event on a different night. 
M:   Hmm . . . in that case, why don’t you check if 
there is a room available on Saturday? We can 
push the event back one evening.
W2:  Sure thing. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
and floor plan. 
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello, I’m Patty Alpert. I was supposed to be here 
at 9 a.m. for my orientation since I’m a new hire. I 
got into a minor car accident, though, so I’m a bit 
late. 
M:  Oh, that’s unfortunate. I hope that you’re all right. 
W:  Yes, it wasn’t too serious . . . just time consuming. 
Where should I go now?
M:  Right now, everyone is working in groups doing 
customer service role-playing exercises. 
W:  OK. Which group am I in?
M:  Let me check. Um, we’re just inside the entrance 
to the auditorium now. Looking straight ahead, you 
should join the group directly to the left of the 
stage. I can bring you over if you’d like.
W:  That’s not necessary. I can find them on my own. 
Thanks.

W:  Isaac, can you explain the details of our hair 
salon’s plan to attract customers in March?  
M:  We’re going to discount our services up to 50 
percent for the month.
W:  Which services are going to be featured?
M:  All of them, but we’ve chosen to give the biggest 
discount to the service preferred by over 20 
percent of our customers. It has the highest profit 
margin. 
W:  I see. And is there a list of the specific prices and 
discounts someplace?
M:  Bradley is making a sign with those details now. 
Once he’s finished, the receptionist will post it at 
the main entrance.

is going to be closed next week. It’s being 
expanded and resurfaced. 
M:  Yeah. Everyone from our office is gonna have to 
park elsewhere for four days . . . Luckily, Friday’s 
a holiday.
W:  Right. Fortunately, our company has offered to 
pay the fees we’re charged for parking. But the 
garage they recommended is four blocks away.
M:  Oh, really? Why can’t we use Madison Street 
Parking? It’s just one block from here.
W:  I guess that one and the Mulberry Lane Lot are for 
private use only. We could use Clyde’s Parking

I want to update you on the progress of our labor 
negotiations with management. I ’m happy to 
announce that talks are going smoothly. We have 
already agreed to limit the number of work hours per 
week to a maximum of 45. Moreover, management 
has agreed to offer additional benefits and make 
improvements to the working environment of the

much wages will be increased. However, we are 
making a lot of headway on this situation. If things

this upcoming Monday.

This program thanks customers who have had our 
service for three or more years by offering them a new 
phone at a greatly reduced price. We’re currently 
offering the newly released FlexTouch 3. All you have 
to do to get the new phone for only $50 is visit our 
Web site and fill out a short consumer satisfaction 
survey. Once we receive your survey, we’ll send you 
the new device. Tek Wireless will cover the shipping 
charges, so no need to worry. If you’d like more

Our next lecturer at this year’s Ontario Environmental 
Convent ion is  Professor  Clarence Meyers.  
Mr. Meyers teaches at Scotland University, and today 
he is going to explain what type of an impact climate 
change is going to have on Canada over the next 
century. To support his predictions, Mr. Meyers will be 
showing us a series of diagrams and tables that detail 
the results of his recent research. You’ll want to pay 
close attention to this part, since the data is extremely 
interesting and educational. He’ll then conclude by 
explaining the habitat and wildlife conservation bill he 
is currently lobbying Parliament to pass. All right,  
Mr. Meyers. You may begin when you’re ready.

Good afternoon, everyone. I’d like to congratulate you 
all for being promoted to sales team managers. Few 
of our salespeople make it this far. Now, we’ll go over 
the available benefits for your new positions. Let’s all 
refer to page 22 of the management handbook I 
previously distributed. We don’t need to discuss pay 
increases today. Everyone gets the same percentage 
increase. Some of the other more complicated benefits, 
however, need more attention. As you can see, there 
are many pension plans available to you. You’ll need to 
read through these before deciding which is best for 
you. If you need assistance, please contact Hazel in 
human resources. She’s an expert in these matters. Are 
there any questions so far?
Questions 89-91 refer to the following talk.
영국식	발음
As most of you know, our resort has been conducting 
customer surveys over the course of this past summer. 
The goal of the study is to get feedback from visitors 
about how we can improve our facility and services. We 
received a lot of comments about our small and 
outdated swimming pool. Since so many respondents 
made comments about this issue, we have decided to 
build a new pool that’s twice the size of our current one. 
We are also going to enlarge our outdoor lounge area.

Our company makes an annual donation to support a 
worthy cause. This year will be no different, and we 
will hold a bake sale to raise funds for establishing the 
“Playroom of Hope” at the Hurles Children’s Hospital 
in Orlando. Employees from all departments will 
volunteer by baking items at home for the sale, such

their items at designated sites around the city on 
December 3. Proceeds will be used to buy toys, 
books, and other equipment needed in the playroom. I 
plan to send you all an e-mail describing the hospital’s

benefit children with special needs.

Good afternoon, Mr. Reynolds. This is Marsha Fields 
from Cline and Peterman Law Firm returning your call. 
I’m fine with moving our meeting about your patent 
from 11 a.m. Thursday to 2 p.m. Friday as you 
requested in your message. It will give me more time 
to do some research for our meeting. Um, I have a 
few ideas about how to resolve your patent dispute 
that I look forward to discussing with you. Oh, one 
thing I should mention . . . Our office is being 
renovated, so we are temporarily using the one that 
was occupied by an accounting firm. That company 
relocated last month and is still listed on the directory. 
Don’t get confused. Thanks.

M:  Something spacious enough for four people. Also,

We have quite a bit of luggage.
W:  Of course. The CX2 sedan seats five people 
comfortably and has plenty of storage space. If

see your credit card and driver’s license in order to

type of paint you choose. If you can give me that

sending in an application to attend this year’s 
National Jewelry Expo to better advertise my work. 
M:  That’s a great idea. You could attract a lot of 
customers. Provided that you actually go . . . 
W:  You think so? I’m still a bit hesitant. Operating a 
booth there can be expensive.
M:  Numerous people have used exposure from that 
event to help boost their businesses. I’m sure the 
same would happen for you. 
W:  You’re right . . . I’m gonna download the application 
form now and fill it out.

W:  I’d like to discuss a recent assignment that you 
collaborated with the marketing team on.
M:  No problem. Is there something specific you’d like 
to discuss?
W:  Yes, there is. You included an incorrect location in 
this online advertisement. It states that there will 
be a sale at our Seattle branch on July 22. 
However, the sale is actually going to be at our 
Portland branch. 
M:  Really? I’m so sorry about that! I must have missed 
that while proofreading the advertisement. I will 
make the necessary changes to the advertisement 
immediately.

W1:  Hey, Randy. Doesn’t your shift start at 9 o’clock? 
M:   Yeah, I came in early this morning to unpack the 
Digi 5 game consoles. They just arrived, and we 
need to get them on the shelves.
W1:  I see. Here . . . I’ll help.
W2:  Sorry to interrupt. I know we don’t open for five 
more minutes, but some customers have already 
started to form a line at the door. They’re here for 
the Digi 5.
W1:  I was going to keep stocking the shelves after we 
opened, but we’d better finish soon if people are 
lined up.
M:   Maybe one of us should ask Richard to give us a 
hand.
W2:  I can do that.
M:  Thanks. He should be in the storeroom. 
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation. 
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Jeff, I’m worried our cinema branch in Westchester 
requires extra personnel to handle the summer 
movie season. This is the busiest time of the year.
M:  Yeah, the branch supervisor seems to think that’s 
an important issue to address. He’d like three 
more people added to the evening shift.
W:  In that case, could you make a job posting? Just 
include some basic details of the position and the 
minimum qualifications required.
M:  Sure. I’ll try to finish it before I break for lunch.
W:  That’d be ideal. I’ll publish it on our company Web 
site later this afternoon.

M:  Hello, I’m calling to reserve three tickets for the

W:  It’s $40 per person. The tour begins at 9 a.m. and 
will last two and a half hours.
M:  Hmm. That’s higher than I had expected. Have 
your rates changed recently? My friend went on

Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Erin, I met up with our realtor a few hours ago. He 
showed me a vacant space that would be perfect 
for our recording studio. 
W:  Was the unit in a building on Ferguson Avenue? If 
so, I received an e-mail from him about the 
vacancy last night. 
M:  Yes, that’s the one. The space has a very practical 
layout. Plus, there is enough room for a reception 
area and a private office. I was even introduced to 
the owner of the building, Janet Davidson. She 
was quite welcoming and professional.
W:  That sounds promising. Would you arrange 
another showing for tomorrow? I’d like to see the 
property too.

M:  Have you loaded the scuba gear into the boat yet? 
We need enough equipment to take 10 people on 
a diving trip.
W:  Yeah, but I discovered a crack in one of the 
masks.
M:  Really? That’s a problem since the other dive 
group has taken all the spare ones with them.
W:  Hmm . . . Splash World, the dive supply shop, is 
really close to here. If they have any in stock, I can 
go pick one up. Why don’t you give them a call 
and see if they have what we need?
M:  Good idea! I’ll get right on that. Only . . . do you 
know the store’s phone number?
W:  No, but I bet Reggie does.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hello. I’m in town for the medical equipment trade 
fair. Unfortunately, we have run out of brochures 
at our company’s booth. I have everything you will 
need saved on this memory card and was 
wondering if I could get 300 copies printed today. 
M:  I’m sorry, but our schedule is really busy. The 
soonest I could get them to you is tomorrow 
afternoon.
W:  Hmm. I think that’s too late, as I need them as 
soon as possible. Are there any other print shops 
nearby? 
M:  There aren’t any others in this area. I’m afraid the 
closest one is on Dover Boulevard. You should 
take a taxi, though, as it closes in 30 minutes. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:   I think I’m ready for a new cell phone. Do either of 
you have any recommendations?
W1:  My phone has worked out great—the ShockPhone 
20. It’s fast, and it has a modern design.
M:   I’ve heard that model’s great, but it’s out of my 
budget.
W2:  Mine’s a PlusTouch 50. It’s pretty basic, but it’s 
only $190.
M:   The more cost-effective one sounds better. I’ll 
purchase one at Harbor Cellular this weekend.
W1:  I heard that store is closed for renovations this 
month. 
W2:  Looks like you’ll have to go to Graystone 
Electronics instead. Fortunately, it’s having a sale.
M:   Thanks for the information. I wasn’t aware about 
Harbor’s closing.
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and building directory.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Excuse me. I’m scheduled to meet with Harvey 
Pinkerton. However, the office listed for him on the 
directory here in the lobby is incorrect. I went up to 
the second floor, but someone else was using the 
office which the directory mentions.
M:  Oh, I ’m very sorry for the inconvenience.  
Mr. Pinkerton is in another office, but the directory 
has yet to be updated. He should have told you 
about this. 
W:  So it seems . . . Well, where is his new one?
M:  He’s moved into Mr. Johnson’s old office, which is 
down the hallway and to the right. Just beside 
Markus Swanson’s office.
W:  OK, I’ll head there now. Thanks. 
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation 
and coupon.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  Hi. My blender broke down, so I need help finding 
a replacement. Also, I wanna use this coupon for 
15 percent off that I cut out of a local newspaper.
W:  I’d be happy to assist you. Is there a particular 
model you are interested in?
M:  I’m not sure, but I’d prefer not to spend more than 
$200. Do you have any suggestions?
W:  Well, the Dicer 2 and the Total Blend are both in 
your price range, and they’re made by PowerMix. 
The ChopMaster is Electrostar’s most popular 
model . . . and the most expensive. It’s over $400. 
But that company also sells the BlendPro, which is 
only $175.

Good morning, and welcome to this seminar on 
European clothing trends. I will be your lecturer today. 
My name is Caroline LeGrand, and I head the design 
department at Tyler Sharp Apparel. I’m delighted to 
see such a large turnout here today, as I will be 
discussing a very interesting topic that affects 
everyone within the fashion industry. All of you were 
handed a copy of today’s program, which outlines 
everything that will take place. The lecture should last 
about two hours and take us right into lunch at noon. 
Then, the afternoon session will get underway at 1 
o’clock. For that segment, another fashion designer, 
Liv Holbein, will give a slide show presentation. OK, 
now let’s begin.

Hello, everyone. Thank you all for coming to the grand 
reopening of the Norfield Planetarium. Upon entering 
the building today, you’ll be pleased to see that the 
majority of its sections have been completely 
renovated. In particular, our exhibit hall has undergone 
considerable changes. It now features a variety of 
educational displays that you can interact with through 
touch screen technology. And to commemorate this 
special day, local astronomer Shane Donner will make 
a speech about his recent findings in his studies of 
outer space in Lecture Room B. However, that will be 
pushed back an hour later than planned . . . Mr. 
Donner is making preparations. In the meantime, 
please feel free to explore the facility.

I’d like to let everyone know that our paper shredder will 
be replaced tomorrow. A technician looked at it this 
morning, and it appears that there is a serious problem 
with the blades that cut the paper. Plus, it’s old and  
out-of-date. So now is the perfect time to get a new one. 
If you need to shred anything before then, just use the 
one in the accounting department’s office on the third 
floor. I think that’s everything. Oh, hold on . . . we need 
someone to come in at 8 a.m. tomorrow to give the 
delivery person access to our office. Please let me know 
by 5 p.m. today if you wish to volunteer to do this.

Hello. This is Tyrone Dyson calling from the city of 
Dallas’s Department of Parks and Recreation. I 
received your message yesterday about possibly 
reserving the main room at the Pointer Park 
Community Center for a gathering on Saturday, 
September 2. Unfortunately, another group has 
already booked the space for that specific date you 
requested. However, I’ve contacted Dallas’ other 
community center near Gleeson Park and was 
informed that they do have a space available at that 
time. If you are interested in booking that room, let me 
know. You can check out details and photos of the 
space by visiting www.dallasrecreation.gov. Thanks, 
and have a great day.

My name is Samir Nasser, and I’m a consultant and 
motivational speaker. I’ve been invited here by your 
employer to speak about how developing strong 
communication skills can improve your work life. As 
telemarketers for a software company, your ability to 
communicate with customers is obviously an essential 
part of your job. It enables you to express your 
thoughts clearly and concisely, which will in turn 
improve clients’ confidence in you. But communication 
skills are not only important when it comes to 
increasing sales. They’re also crucial for fostering 
healthy work relationships. In fact, the number one 
cause of workplace conflict is poor communication. To 
help prevent such issues, I’d like us all to participate in 
some activities together aimed at strengthening 
interactions between colleagues.

Good morning, Richard. This is Sally. We need to find 
a new location for our department’s Christmas party 
next month. I just called Golden China—the restaurant 
we discussed yesterday—but they said that 30 seats 
are not  avai lab le on that  day.  They could 
accommodate us if we broke into smaller groups . . . 
but that’s not really a good option. I was hoping you 
could call the new restaurant that opened on the 
corner of Jefferson Street and Parkinson Boulevard, 
right next to city hall. I heard they have a private 
dining room! I’d call them myself, but I’m headed to 
the airport now. With the party coming up in only three 
weeks, we need to make a reservation as soon as 
possible. Thanks.

It’s that time of year again—Game Warehouse’s 
Summer Blowout Sale. Unlike in previous years, some 
sales items are discounted up to 70 percent and game 
systems are now included. If you’re planning on 
purchasing a new system, then visit the Game 
Warehouse from July 20 until August 5. And if you 
make a purchase of $250 or more during this event, 
we will throw in a free gaming accessory worth up to 
$30 as a gift. Note that cables and adaptors for game 
consoles do not qualify as gifts for this promotion. 
Check out our Web site for more information about 
this event. We hope to see you soon!

Welcome to Entertainment News. The organizer of 
the annual Calgary Music Festival has announced an 
interesting addition to the lineup of daily headliners. 
The press release from Lisa Gomez, who is in charge 
of booking acts, stated that international superstar DJ 
James Money will join his former partner Karl Slocum 
for the first time in over a decade at the festival. This 
is very exciting news for local music lovers. Viewers 
interested in attending should purchase tickets soon, 
as they are likely to sell out quickly. A pass for the 
entire festival costs $49, while tickets for individual 
concerts cost $30. And remember, half of the 
proceeds will be donated to a local orphanage, so you 
will be supporting a worthy cause while enjoying some 
great music.

PART 3
Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Ms. Wheeler, I’m calling from Bernard Flooring. 
Unfortunately, we have to postpone your Tuesday 
appointment to have new carpet laid in your home. 
We’re going to be understaffed for the next couple 
of days and won’t be able to make it then. Thursday 
is the earliest we can come.
W:  That’s going to be inconvenient for me, as I’ll be 
busy on that day. Could you possibly do the work 
on Wednesday instead? 
M:  No, we’re fully booked on Wednesday as well. To 
make up for the inconvenience, though, I can take 
15 percent off your final bill. 
W:  OK. I’ll make time on Thursday then. 
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  A group of investors will be stopping by the office 
in five days. While they’re here, I want someone to 
give a presentation to them on our recent 
expansion into the South American market. Would 
you be willing to do that?
W:  Normally, I would be. However, my team is working 
on another assignment, which is due in a few days. 
Unfortunately, I won’t have enough time to take on 
both tasks before the investors arrive.
M:  Oh, that’s right! I forgot you’re conducting research 
for a financial analysis. Well, the presentation is 
more pressing than the analysis, so please 
prioritize that. You should work on the other 
assignment later.
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation. 
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello. I have a reservation at your resort. My name 
is Wanda Fleming. 
M:  Welcome to the Oasis Hotel. Let me check our 
database for your booking . . . That’s odd. I don’t 
see your name, Ms. Fleming. 
W:  Really? I booked it on your Web site earlier in the 
day while I was in Boston. Here’s the receipt. 
M:  Hmm . . . yes, this looks accurate.
W:  Then, why isn’t it on record?
M:  Did you receive any error messages when you 
made the booking? I really have no idea how this 
could have happened. 
W:  No . . . nothing like that. I’m a little worried, since 
the room has already been charged to my card.
M:  I’ll get my manager. This is an unusual case, so 
she’ll have to help you. Just a moment.
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  It’s Mitchell Joyce calling. Is the consumer research 
report for Vector Shoes ready yet? I’ll be consulting 
with the company’s director tomorrow, and I’d like to 
show it to him. 
W:  The report is nearly finished. I’m just waiting for 
some additional statistics from a colleague before I 
can finalize it. Everything will be completed by this 
afternoon. 
M:  Great. It would be best if you could bring a hard 
copy of the final report to my assistant. He’ll pass it 
on to me when I return to the office. 
W: OK. I’ll get one to him no later than 3 o’clock. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation. 
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  My name is Rosmarie Devry and I am calling in 
regard to the dental assistant position you recently 
advertised. Is the job still available? I have over 
five years of relevant experience and would like to 
apply if it is.
M:  Yes, we are still trying to fill the position. We’re 
asking all applicants to provide us with a cover 
letter and a copy of their résumé before May 14, 
which is the deadline for submissions. So, could 
you send those documents to me at jose12@
parkerdental.com?
W:  Oh, good. Yes, I’ll e-mail you those items later 
today. I’d appreciate it if you could notify me when 
you receive them.
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hi. I recently bought a protective cover for my laptop 
computer on your Web site. However, I’d like to 
exchange it. The one I purchased is too small.
M:  So long as the item isn’t damaged, we’re happy to 
exchange it for you. However, you’ll be charged for 
the extra shipping and handling fees related to your 
request.
W:  That’s fine. I’m also hoping you can help me figure 
out which case will fit my computer. 
M:  If you provide the brand name and model of your 
laptop, I can look up the proper item code. You 
can then use the code to search for the product on 
our Web site.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers. 
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   I really appreciate you two stopping to help me 
out.
M1:  Don’t worry about it. We couldn’t pass by knowing 
someone was stranded on the roadside. 
M2:  Now, what seems to be the problem with your 
car?

W:   Well . . . I’ve got a flat tire, so I guess I’ll have to 
call a tow truck. 
M2:  That’s not necessary if you have a spare and a 
jack in the trunk.
W:   I . . . um . . . I think I do. Let me see. Yeah, 
everything’s good to go.
M1:  In that case, we can help you change the tire. 
The replacement work shouldn’t take us very 
long.
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  Please stand over here and raise your arms. I 
need to take one final measurement for your 
jacket.
M:  Certainly. But, before I forget . . . how much will 
everything cost?
W:  About $75. However, if the jacket takes longer 
than two hours to alter, it’ll be slightly more.
M:  That seems a bit steep, but I suppose it’s worth it 
for quality work. Oh . . . one last thing. When will 
the suit be ready?
W:  I should be done altering it by next Tuesday. 
M:  That’s actually convenient, since I need to consult 
with a customer in this neighborhood then anyway.  
W:  Great. Just note that we don’t open until 11 a.m.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  This is Liam Gates calling from Ondine Bank. We 
are hosting our annual awards ceremony next 
month, and my associate strongly suggested using 
your company. I was wondering if we could meet 
this week to discuss the possibility of your 
business catering the event.
W:  I would be happy to do that, Mr. Gates. Most of my 
afternoons this week are free.
M:  What about tomorrow? Could you meet me here at 
our headquarters on Larson Avenue at two?
W:  That’s fine. But before we meet, I suggest you 
take a look at our Web site. There are examples of 
menus we’ve prepared in the past as well as price 
lists. It should give you a better idea of what types 
of food we offer.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  I just had a meeting with our restaurant manager. 
He said that all the staff working in the dining area 
will have to wear uniforms starting next month. 
What do you think about that?
W:  Why not? Employees in other establishments wear 
them to look more presentable and organized. And 
think of the time it’ll save us every morning. We 
won’t have to figure out what to wear to work 
anymore.
M:  You’re probably right. It’ll also be easier for 
customers to identify staff if we’re all wearing the 
same type of clothing.
W:  I just hope the uniforms aren’t uncomfortable to 
wear.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
and table.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Excuse me. I’m in the market for a kitchen range. I 
have the dimensions of the space that the stove 
will fill with me, but I need help making a selection. 
W:  How wide do you need the device to be? And are 
there any specific features that you want the 
appliance to have?
M:  Thirty inches. Plus, I’d like a built-in timer, a gas-
powered cooktop and oven, and a stainless steel 
exterior. 
W:  Hmm . . . then, either the Brenmar or Flame is the 
best option. Other brands like Hegal and Anderson 
only come in larger sizes.
M:  Also, my budget tops out at $1,800.
W:  In that case, we’ve got just the model for you.
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and product manual. 
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Hello. I’m calling to express my dissatisfaction with 
a tent I purchased from your sporting goods store 
yesterday. 
M:  OK. I can assist you with that. What seems to be 
the problem?
W:  Well, neither of the two largest poles came in the 
box. I have the other poles and pegs but am 
unable to assemble the tent. 
M:  I apologize for the inconvenience, ma’am. We’ll 
gladly provide you with the missing parts if you 
bring your receipt to our shop within 30 days.
W:  All right. I’ll do that this afternoon, since my office 
is near the shopping center your store is in.
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation 
and map.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  I’m glad you’ve joined me at the Mint Gallery today. 
I’m a huge fan of the painter being featured here 
right now. 
M:  Well, thanks for inviting me. Should we go buy our 
passes now?  
W:  We don’t have to. My company gave me a couple 
of free tickets for this event. Oh, by the way . . . 
where did you park?
M:  I couldn’t find a spot on West Street, so I parked in 
front of the store on the corner of Lilac and Fern 
Street . . . the one closest to the gallery.
W:  But that’s a no parking zone. There’s a parking lot 
just down the street, um, next to the café. You 
should move your car there right away.

Before we leave for the day, I’d like to remind everyone 
that our second office will open next week. The new 
furniture has been delivered and our moving date has 
been scheduled. But . . . well . . . we’ve got a lot to do 
before then. Those of you transferring will need to 
return your ID badges, pick up new security clearance 
tags, update your listings in the employee directory, 
and notify your clients of your new contact information 
in advance. If you have any questions about things 
like the office layout or available facilities, contact 
George Jennings, who is in charge of the new office.
Questions 77-79 refer to the following telephone 
message.

This is Gwen Stevens from Horizon Landscaping 
calling for Paul Carranza. We’ve come up with several 
proposals for the design of your building’s courtyard. I 
would like to install a decorative fountain in the middle 
of the space. I also suggest planting a variety of 
flowers along the courtyard’s main path. That will 
make the space feel very relaxing. If you don’t care for 
that idea, however, I have sketches of other possible 
designs as well. Could you call me back and let me 
know what would be a good time for us to meet and 
go through the proposals? Thank you for this 
opportunity, and I look forward to getting started.
Questions 80-82 refer to the following speech. 
호주식	발음
Welcome to the annual Olympia Heart Association 
meeting. It’s surprising that so many of you made it 
despite the storm. I’m happy to say that we have a 
very special guest with us tonight—Dr. Mildred 
Jenkins. I’m sure you’ve heard of her. Not only was 
Dr. Jenkins the first female heart surgeon to set up a 
practice in Olympia, but she was also our association’s 
first female president and the founder of our program 
to improve heart health among children in the city. 
Tonight, she will give us an update about her ongoing 
initiative to remove unhealthy snacks from local 
schools. Now, without further ado, let’s welcome  
Dr. Jenkins to the stage.
Questions 83-85 refer to the following announcement.
캐나다식	발음
Could I have everyone’s attention for a few moments? I 
just want to go over a couple of reminders before we 
start our shift. First, our order of new protective goggles 
has arrived. So, please pick up a pair before heading to 
the factory floor. Also, we have an inspection on Friday, 
so make sure to report any equipment problems to the 
technical department as soon as possible. That way, 
they will have sufficient time to make repairs before the 
inspection takes place. Finally, please ensure that your 
work areas are tidy and in order before you go home 
today. 
Questions 86-88 refer to the following excerpt from a 
meeting. 
미국식	발음	
Good afternoon, everyone. I just met with the customer 
service manager to discuss the response to our newest 
e-Book reader—the Universe Plus. It really took me 
by surprise. The Universe Plus is our most advanced 
model ever, so I thought it would be well received, but 
many customers complained that the screen is too dark 
and the operating system is too complicated. Not much 
can be done about the screen until the next annual 
release, but I think our team can fix the software 
problem. I’m going to e-mail all of you copies of the 
complaints now. I’d like you to look over them and think 
of a way to address the problem. 
Questions 89-91 refer to the following advertisement.
영국식	발음
Are you looking for a bargain on furniture? Look no 
further than Fair Value. Located in downtown Astoria,

prices. Not only that, but all paying customers receive 
instant membership to our online auction site at www.

weekend, and we’ll also include free delivery for 
purchases of $600 or more.

Our team will be responsible for finding corporate 
sponsors. We plan to work in partnership with airlines, 
hotel chains, and other tourism-based businesses to

next meeting, you all need to come up with lists of 
potential companies that we should get in touch with.

Thank you all for joining Synergy’s beta test session. 
As you know, we produce bookkeeping programs for 
small companies such as yours. Well . . . in February, 
we’re replacing our best-selling program with a 
successor. Ledger Pro—the new program—builds 
upon the strengths of our top program and adds 
features that were requested in the customer 
experience surveys you previously submitted. For the 
test session, we’ll update your systems to Ledger Pro, 
and you will simply continue to perform your 
bookkeeping duties as you have in the past. If you 
come across any glitches or errors, just send us a 
quick e-mail. It’s that simple. 
Questions 98-100 refer to the following telephone 
message and order form. 
영국식	발음
Good morning. This is Glenda Brown from LMZ 
Investments. I need to change an order that I recently 
placed on your Web site. Christina Chine, the 
manager of our new office in Miami, just notified me 
that she will have a larger staff than planned. We have 
some extra desks that can be used, and we won’t 
require additional cubicle partitions or file cabinets . . . 
but I need to double the number of seats. We’ll need, 
uh, 30 in total. The accounting manager wants me to 
use a different company credit card to pay for the new 
charges, so please call me back for the number and 
expiration date. My contact details are included on the 
original order form. Thank you.

PART 3
Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation. 
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Good afternoon. I’m here to drop off the car I 
rented for the weekend. The vehicle is an SXA 
390 sedan, and my name is Jenna Clarkson. 
M:  OK. I’d just like to ask you a couple of questions 
regarding the vehicle. First, was the car scratched 
or otherwise damaged while you were using it? 
Also, did you refill the gas tank prior to dropping it 
off, as is stipulated in the rental agreement?
W:  The car is undamaged, but I unfortunately wasn’t 
able to put gas in the tank before coming here. 
M:  Oh, then I’ll have to charge you an additional fee. 
Please wait a moment while I make the adjustment 
to your bill.   
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  It seems like the book fair went well overall. 
M:  For the most part. However, fewer people showed 
up than expected. That was a bit of a letdown. 
W:  Yeah, I was a little disappointed by that as well. 
Personally, I think we should have advertised more 
for the event in order to attract more participants.
M:  That’s what I told our boss, Ms. Gabbert, a few 
weeks ago. I thought she would approve extra 
advertising. Do you have any clue as to why she 
didn’t?
W:  I think she couldn’t allocate any more money to 
promote the fair because our budget had already 
been used for other projects.
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Susan, I was very impressed with the article you 
composed last Thursday about popular Kentsville 
dining spots. Also, a lot of people have posted on 
social media about one of the places you mentioned, 
Lima Kitchen, the Peruvian restaurant that opened 
just recently.
W:  Thanks, Chris. It’s nice to hear that the public is 
pleased with what I wrote.
M:  Given the positive feedback, maybe something 
similar is in order. You should write another piece 
about a different new dining establishment in the 
area.
W:  I’ve been asked to do just that, actually. I’m about to 
go to our head editor’s office to discuss that 
assignment right now.
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers. 
호주식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M1:  Allen and Carla, there isn’t enough space in our 
garage for the amount of repair work that we 
have been getting. What do you two think about 
moving to a larger facility?
M2:  Hmm . . . I’m not sure. We’d probably have to 
move far away. I’m worried that local patrons will 
take their business to competitors if we relocate. 
W:   Actually, the vacant lot next door was just put up 
for sale. If we acquire it, we could have a bigger 
facility constructed on the land. That way, we 
would be able to expand right here.
M1:  That would be perfect! Let’s start by determining 
how much the parcel of land is being sold for.
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Good afternoon. I’m currently employed as an 
intern at a law firm, and I’m interested in registering 
for the writing course your institute offers for legal 
professionals.  
W:  OK. We have two courses on that subject . . . um, 
Writing 103 and 204. 
M:  Yeah, I saw that when I went through your online 
course catalog this morning. I’d like to take the 
advanced class because the lower-level one 
covers a lot of material that I’m already familiar 
with. Will that be a problem?
W:  Not at all. I’ll give you a few forms to fill out now, 
and then you will have four days to make the 
payment for the course. Once you are registered, 
the instructor will e-mail you further information 
about the class. 
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Stan, I just watched the promotional video you put 
together for our donut shop. 
M:  What do you think of it?
W:  It looks good, but I’m worried because the sale 
we’re having on cream-filled donuts isn’t mentioned 
in it.
M:  Unfortunately, the advertisement only runs for 30 
seconds, so I couldn’t include everything. 
W:  Maybe you could edit out the part showing the 
inside of our business to allow for the other content. 
M:  You’d be fine with that? You specifically asked for 
it to be included before.

M:  Hello. This is Danny Martinson calling from 
Westend Boutique. I’m sorry, but the evening 
gown you ordered online was returned to our 
shipping facility, as the address you entered was 
inaccurate. 
W:  I apologize for that. Could you please resend it? I 
live at 3258 Pleasant Avenue, Denver, Colorado. 
M:  Certainly. It’ll take about five days to reach you. 
W:  OK, that’s acceptable. While I have you on the 
phone, can you explain how to use discount 
coupons on your Web site? I’ve had trouble with 
them in the past.
M:  Before you complete your order, click the green 
“Promotions” button on the bottom of the page. 
Then, type the coupon code into the box that 
appears to apply the discount and click “Submit.”
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  OK, Ms. Kelly, what seems to be the problem with 
your wrist?
W:  Well, it’s been bothering me a lot at my job lately. I 
bend my right wrist repetitively at work, so I think 
that might be the cause of the pain. I work in a 
shoe manufacturing facility, and I’m often pulling 
levers on massive equipment.
M:  I see. In that case, I’ll prescribe you some pain-
killing medication. However, I recommend you 
speak with your boss about ways to ensure that 
the constant motions aren’t causing you any injury 
in the meantime.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Candace, we’ve been advertising the programmer 
position for three weeks, but very few people have 
applied. Plus, none of the candidates have enough 
relevant work experience.
W:  Hmm . . . I’ll tell representatives from the recruitment 
Web site to run the advertisement for another week. 
Also, I think we should consider placing the job 
posting on some social media sites to attract 
applicants.
M:  I agree. Dylan Marks from the human resources 
department is familiar with those types of sites. 
After our 10 a.m. staff meeting, I’ll ask which ones 
he feels are most effective. 
W:  If he offers specific suggestions, can you let me 
know after lunch? That way I can upload the posting 
this afternoon.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers. 
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
W1:  Welcome to First United Bank. How can I help 
you?
M:   I’m here to apply for a loan to support my small 
business. I read about your financial services in 
the Folsom Herald.
W2:  Sorry, but I can assist you at this window 
regarding that matter, sir. My name is Jessica, 
and I work in the loan department. 
M:   Oh, sure. I own a self-service laundry facility, 
which needs multiple new washing and drying 
machines. The total amount of money I’ll need for 
them is $30,000. 
W2:  OK. However, the first step is completing a loan 
application. That will allow us to determine how 
much you qualify for. So, we should get started 
on that right away.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  You’re watching Priority Home Shopping. Today, 
I’ll be talking to Madeline Hartman about her firm’s 
best selling product.
W:  That’s right. Braxton Industries’ ES32 is the first 
suitcase with a magnetic luggage tag, a protective 
cover, and a removable travel pouch. 
M:  Amazing! This item certainly offers some great 
features.
W:  We’ve even added a built-in battery charger. With 
this suitcase, travelers can charge their phones on 
the go.
M:  Wow! Is it available now?
W:  Yes. And we are offering it to Priority Home 
Shopping viewers at 50 percent off its regular 
price. Interested shoppers should order soon, 
however, as this discount will be applicable for a 
limited time.
M:  When, exactly, will the sale end?
W:  On October 1.
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and receipt.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Hello, and welcome to Engel’s Department Store. 
Is there anything I can help you with?
W:  There is. I recently purchased some clothing here, 
and I noticed this pair of shoes was incorrectly 
scanned in as the more expensive deluxe version 
of the Wriggly line. 
M:  Let me confirm the error quickly . . . Yes, you’re 
right. I apologize for the mistake. I can give you a 
slip indicating store credit for the difference. 
W:  That’ll do. Oh . . . by the way, I wanna return this 
shirt, which I purchased at the same time. 
M:  Sorry, but sale items can’t be refunded.

W:  Here you go. I’m really looking forward to this

musicians, and I’m a longtime supporter of The 
Helpline Foundation. 
M:  That’s great. This is the second fundraiser that 
we’ve held for that group. OK, you’re in seat 122, 
which is in section D. Just head through the main 
entrance and an usher will assist you. The show 
will start at half past seven.

message.

Hi, Ryan. It’s Martin Dickey from the International 
Business Institute. I just received a copy of the speech 
you plan to give for our lecture series on infrastructure 
investment and overseas development. Overall, I’m 
very pleased with i t .  However, I  do have a 
recommendation. You might want to use visual 
materials to illustrate the data in your report—
photographs or charts, for example. One other thing . 
. . I’m wondering if you would mind presenting on 
June 14 instead of June 15. Carol Wilkins was 
originally scheduled for the 14th, but she has to travel 
to New York to meet with a supplier. She asked me to 
push her lecture back a day, so it’d be great if you 
could move yours forward.
Questions 74-76 refer to the following talk. 
캐나다식	발음
I’m very excited to be here at the National Restaurant 
Association’s annual trade show at the Brighton 
Exhibition Hall, and I’d like to take this opportunity to 
tell you about Vend Corporation’s newest commercial 
dishwasher, the Clear Flow XS. Made almost entirely 
of stainless steel, the Clear Flow XS is durable and 
easy to clean. In addition, because of its innovative 
design, this appliance uses significantly less power 
than other models, which saves money and benefits the 
environment. And, of course, it is covered by Vend 
Corporation’s comprehensive, five-year warranty. Now, 
I’m sure many of you are wondering about cost, and I’ll 
go over that in detail soon. But first, I’d like to give a 
brief demonstration of this amazing product in action.
Questions 77-79 refer to the following advertisement. 
미국식	발음
If you’re planning on building your own home, then now 
is the time to buy property! Silver Property Management 
is selling a large number of undeveloped, one-acre lots 
along Lake Brandon at reasonable prices. These lots 
have spectacular views and ample space for a range of 
landscaping possibilities. Another advantage is that 
while these properties have never had homes erected 
on them, they are ready to be connected to Hartford 
County’s water, electric, and sewer systems. There is a 
great deal of interest in these lots, and we expect them 
to sell out quickly. Don’t miss out on this great 
opportunity! If you would like someone to show you 
around our site on Lake Brandon, call our office at 555-
9000 to make an appointment.

May I have everyone’s attention? As the volunteer 
coordinator, I’d like to welcome you to the Fairfield 
Senior Center. Our facility is on a tight budget, so your 
assistance is greatly appreciated. First, I would like to 
briefly explain your duties. You will be expected to 
organize activities, which means, you’ll be required to 
assist with the setup and scheduling of events at our 
facility. These activities are aimed at helping residents 
improve their mental and physical health. OK, since I 
have copies of everyone’s weekly schedule, I’ll hand 
them out now. And then, we’ll head to the lounge to 
watch a short video with footage of past activities we’ve 
arranged at our center.
Questions 83-85 refer to the following talk.

One last thing before we finish up today . . . It looks 
like we are going to be understaffed next Friday 
because several of our employees will be participating 
in a customer service workshop. This will be a great 
opportunity for them to improve their skills and learn 
new techniques in assisting our service center clients. 
However, we still have to meet the deadline for our 
current project. So, I would like you to notify your team 
members that leave applications for that day will be 
denied unless there is an emergency situation. Don’t 
misunderstand me, though. The policy only applies to 
new requests. Anyone who has already been 
approved to take that day off won’t be affected.

morning stating that he would prefer to promote 
existing employees to fill these roles. He wants each 
hotel to implement a mentorship program for 
employees who demonstrate leadership skills. This

You’re listening to Melbourne Today on 103.9 FM. My 
guest this afternoon is Marsha Summers, a world-
renowned explorer who has been featured on the 
Adventure Channel and the Outdoor Channel, as well 
as in countless magazines and newspapers. For the 
past year, she’s been making her way across the 
world in a privately owned sailboat with a crew of only 
three people. She landed in Australia two days ago 
and departs for Thailand tomorrow. I plan to ask Ms. 
Summers about Marine Protectors, a nonprofit 
organization she founded that is dedicated to 
protecting the wildlife in the world’s oceans. We urge 
all of our listeners to support this group’s efforts. 
Information on how to make a contribution is available

Please also note that West Air Flight 382, originally 
scheduled to depart at 10:30 a.m. for Houston, will be 
delayed due to an issue with one of its fuel lines. 
Technicians are inspecting the aircraft now and will 
update us shortly. More information regarding the 
status of this flight will be provided to passengers at

In local news, limited power outages will occur in 
some Atlanta neighborhoods over the next week as 
Central Georgia Power is upgrading aspects of its 
distribution system around the city. The company 
wants to cause as little inconvenience to customers 
as possible. As a result, outages in residential 
neighborhoods will occur between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., 
and those in commercial areas will occur between 
midnight and 5 a.m. Atlanta residents are invited to 
visit Central Georgia Power’s Web site for a full list of 
scheduled outages. If you experience a power 
disruption inconsistent with the schedule, please 
notify the company’s customer service department, 
which can be reached at 555-9175.
Questions 98-100 refer to the following telephone 
message and sign.

Hi, Sandra. I got your message about the team-building 
exercise you’re arranging for our department. I like 
your idea of playing a soccer game at a park, but it’d 
be best to do it after work rather than on the weekend 
like you originally planned. Many employees commute 
from the suburbs and won’t want to travel on their day 
off. If you agree, then Baker Park isn’t suitable 
because it closes at six o’clock on weekdays. And 
while Pine Park is open until 10:00 p.m., it doesn’t 
have a playing field. So, that leaves Taylor Park or . . . 
um . . . maybe Riverview Park. Let me know which 
one you prefer sometime today. Thanks.

Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Good morning. Do you know who’s responsible for 
editing our company’s brochure for the upcoming 
trade fair? The manager wants to change some of 
the contact information in it, and he asked me to 
pass on his request to whoever is working on it.
M:  Sorry, I’m not sure. But you should talk to Sun 
Nam. She’s overseeing the team that will be 
attending the fair, so she can provide you with that 
information.
W:  All right. I believe she will be out of the office until 
the early afternoon, but I’ll speak with her once she 
returns. Thanks.
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Hello. I purchased this set of plates here on 
Monday. When I got home and took them out of 
the box, I noticed that one of them is broken.
W:  I can assist you with that. If you can provide proof 
of purchase, I would be happy to replace the set or 
give you a refund. Which would you prefer?
M:  I’d like to get another set. However, before you 
complete the transaction, can I grab some wine 
glasses that I want to purchase as well?
W:  Certainly. Just come back to the customer service 
desk once you’re ready to check out.
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Dennis, how much longer will it be until the entrées 
for Table 5 are ready? 
M:  At least 15 minutes. I’m . . . ah . . . I’m struggling to 
keep up with orders since we’re short-staffed 
today.
W:  The diners have been waiting for almost an hour, 
and they’re getting frustrated. 
M:  Sorry, but I don’t know what to tell you. I’m doing 
the best I can.
W:  In that case, I think we’d better give them a 
discount to make up for the delay. I’ll go and see if 
our manager is fine with that. 
M:  OK. I’ll inform you as soon as the food is ready. 
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Ms. Bont, this is Maurice Martin from Red Publishing. 
W:  Good morning, Mr. Martin. Are you calling about 
my manuscript?
M:  Yes. I read over it last month, and it has a lot of 
potential. We received hundreds of submissions, 
but have chosen your book for publication.
W:  Oh, that’s great to hear! I’m so honored!
M:  However, despite our interest, there are some 
problems that must be addressed. Nothing too 
major—mostly stylistic issues. 
W:  OK. Would you like to meet and further discuss 
things?
M:  Yes. Are you available next Tuesday at 1 p.m.? 
There’s a quiet café across the street from my 
office where we could meet. It’s called The Oxford 
Club. 
W:  Wonderful. See you then.  
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

I might not be able to join you at the Autumn Festival 
next Saturday. As it turns out, I have conflicting 
engagements.
M:  I’m sorry to hear that. What do you have to do on 
Saturday?
W:  I just found out that some of my relatives will be in 
town then. I have to entertain them during their 
visit.
M:  Well, you’re welcome to bring them along. I’m sure 
they would enjoy the experience, as the festival 
has a lot of fun activities. Last year I even 
harvested my own pumpkin to carve!
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation. 
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Mr. Warner, I’m wondering if I could have the day 
off on Thursday. I need to go to the dentist for a 
checkup.
M:  That’s not a good day for you to be gone, as we’re 
having a public relations workshop then. Everyone 
in our department is required to attend. You’d 
better possibly schedule your appointment for 
Friday or next Monday.
W:  That’s right! I completely forgot. In that case, I can 
call the clinic and ask if they have an opening on 
Friday instead. I’m sure they will be able to 
accommodate my request.

W1:  What about an online campaign?  
W2:  I’m not sure. Marcus, what do you think about 
changing to online fundraising? 
M:   We could do that. Web-based campaigns cost 
very little, so it could save money. I’m sure it 
would be better than hosting fundraising dinners 
like we do now.
W2:  I see. Well . . . I’m open to the idea. However, I’m 
unfamiliar with the steps we’d need to take.
M:   I organized some campaigns at my previous job 
that were very successful. If you want, I can make 
an initial strategy proposal for you to review.
W1:  Would you? That’d be helpful. 
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M1:  Can you two help me with something?
M2:  Sure, what’s up? 
M1:  An order of office furniture is currently in the 
loading bay on the other side of the factory. 
However, we need to find somewhere else to 
store it until we ship it to the customer—a 
furniture retailer—next Monday. 
W:   I’m on my way to a meeting, so I’m not free at the 
moment. But, I don’t think we have anywhere to 
keep the shipment anyway. We’re currently at 
capacity.
M2:  Actually, Angie told me earlier today that there’s 
some extra space at the south end of the facility.
W:   Oh . . . I wasn’t aware of that. If you can wait, I 
can help in an hour.
M1:  Thanks, but it has to be done as soon as 
possible. So, Josh, please move the crates to 
that area now. 
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  Hello, my name is Raj Shan. I’m calling because 
there’s an issue with my credit card. Its . . . 
magnetic strip is worn, and scanners can’t read it. 
So, I need a replacement.
W:  Certainly, Mr. Shan. To get one, you must fill out 
the necessary form on our Web site.
M:  Can’t we take care of that over the phone?
W:  I’m afraid not. We have a strict procedure for such 
requests. 
M:  Oh, I see.
W:  Just go to our Web site and then click on the card 
replacement link. You’ll find the necessary 
instructions there.
M:  OK. By the way, can I adjust the card’s credit limit 
on the Web site too?
W:  Yep, you’ll be able to do that as well.
M:  Great. Thanks for the information.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	영국식	발음
W1:  Have you filled the vacant manager position at 
our Chicago factory? I’m curious because the 
plant’s assistant manager, Mark Mason, e-mailed 
me about the job this morning. He’d like to apply 
for it.  
W2:  I’ve received a few applications but haven’t 
selected anyone for the position yet. Please tell 
Mr. Mason that I’d be happy to consider his 
application. And since he’s already an employee 
at our company, he doesn’t need to provide any 
reference letters.
W1:  OK, I’ll message him after lunch to let him know. 
He’ll most likely send you his résumé within a day 
or two. Good luck deciding on an applicant.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
and order form.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Christine, is everything ready for the tablet release 
party we’re catering for Stratus Technologies? 
W:  Almost. Yesterday, I submitted the online order 
form to our supplier for the place settings and 
linens we need. They’ll arrive in five days.
M:  Great. Please check everything carefully before 
you sign for the delivery. The last shipment 
contained broken glasses.
W:  I will. Oh, I almost forgot . . . We only need 100 of 
each type of plate, but one of them was on sale. 
So, I ordered some extra ones. 
M:  Good idea. We use those dishes for many of the 
events we cater, so we’ll probably need them in 
the future.
W:  Yeah. That’s what I thought as well.  
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and graph.

M:  I finally had a chance to meet with the president 
and tell her about our new advertising idea for 
smartphone applications. 
W:  And? How did it go?
M:  Not as expected. She feels that the message of 
the advertisement is too complex. She wants us to 
make it more straightforward and easy to 
understand.   
W:  That seems reasonable. Well, maybe we can 
make it more like the one from the campaign we 
launched earlier this year. You know—the 
previous advertisement that was released in the 
month in which we had more than 11,000 views 
for the first time this year.

It’s conducted by Myra Lawrence . . . um, an 
assistant botany professor from a local university.
M:  Actually, I’d like to take one of the classes. 
However, given my work hours, I’ll only be able to

Welcome to the Masami Teahouse in Kyoto, Japan. 
The teahouse was built in the late 1700s and originally

audition for a movie my agency has been hired to do

All of your previous parts have been in action movies.

planned to have engineering companies in room 202,

PART 3
Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  I’m glad that we decided to come to this conference. 
It’s been extremely beneficial so far. I’ve even 
written down a few marketing ideas. I want to use 
them for some of the books our firm plans to 
publish this year.
M:  I agree. All the lectures on promotional strategies 
we heard this morning were very informative.
W:  Yeah. The organizers of this event are actually 
arranging another conference from April 13 to 15. 
We should consider attending that one as well, as it 
will focus on online advertising for firms like ours.
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Thank you for coming in to be interviewed for the 
junior contractor position at our building firm,  
Mr. Shore. Now that the interview is over, do you 
have any questions?
M:  Yes, I do. Will the job require much travel? I went 
on many business trips at my last company and 
wasn’t very fond of that.
W:  Off-site training seminars will be held occasionally, 
but they typically take place at facilities within this 
city. 
M:  So, I won’t be traveling on a regular basis? I just 
want to be clear about this . . . 
W:  Right. And we will give advance notice if it is 
necessary.
M:  Great. Actually, I’m glad that your company 
provides professional training, since it’ll likely help 
me become aware of building changes.
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Excuse me. I’d like to ride this city bus to Fenton 
Street. However, I’m not sure how to properly 
secure my bicycle to the front of the vehicle. Could 
you show me how to use the bike rack? 
M:  I’m very sorry, but the rack is out of order right 
now. The locking mechanism is jammed, so bikes 
can’t be securely fastened to it. 
W:  That’s too bad. Well, how much longer will it take 
for another bus to get here? 
M:  Buses stop at this corner every 15 minutes, so not 
very long. I suggest waiting for the next one. Sorry 
for the inconvenience. 
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  There’s a problem with our online banking system.
W:  Yeah, I heard that some of our customers can’t 
access their transaction records. There must be 
something wrong with our database software. 
M:  That’s right. Can you let Robert Nolan from the IT 
team know about this issue?
W:  I already did. He said that his team should have a 
solution to the problem by tomorrow morning.
M:  OK. Is Robert checking whether our new mobile 
application is affected as well? We need to make 
sure it is set to launch next Monday.
W:  Oh, I’m not sure. I’ll call him back now and check.
M:   Give me an update on that as soon as possible, 
please. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Excuse me. I know you sell green and white 
curtains made by Pearlman, but I can’t see them 
anywhere.
W:  I’m sorry, but we sold out a couple of days ago. 
And because Pearlman will release a new product 
line next month, we won’t be ordering any more.  
M:  Oh, no. I purchased several sets for my apartment 
three weeks ago, but the curtains I got for my 
living room are almost five inches too short. I 
guess I made a mistake when measuring the 
window. 
W:  Well, it’s not all bad news. We carry another brand 
in the store that is made of a similar material and 
has an identical pattern. Here, let me show it to you.
M:  Hmm . . . that’ll work. Thanks for the suggestion.
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Hello. Do you know where the Department of Motor 
Vehicles is located? I have to visit the agency on 
Saturday morning, but as I moved here only two 
months ago, I’ve never been to its offices before. 
W:  Yes, I’ve been there many times before. The 
agency is in a large gray government building on 
Belmont Avenue, across from Freemont Park. You 
can’t miss it. But why do you need to go there?
M:  My driver’s license will expire very soon. I’ve been 
putting the errand off for a while, but it will no longer 
be valid on Monday. So, I’m going to take care of it 
over the weekend. Thanks for the information.
Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:   For the next stage of this focus group meeting, I 
want to ask about the instruction manual for our 
desktop computer. What are your impressions of 
it?

M1:  Personally, I think it could be improved. 
W:   Can you elaborate on which aspects of it need to 
be revised?
M1:  Well . . . the part explaining how to plug in the 
various cords is too vague.
M2:  Yeah, and I couldn’t find any directions on how to 
use the orange cable that’s provided.
W:   OK, I’ll make a note of that. 
M2:  It’d also be useful if the manual had more 
graphics.
M1:  Right—in order to illustrate the various set-up 
steps.
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Natalie, don’t you think we should install automated 
payment machines in our shopping mall’s parking 
lot? 
W:  Definitely. Many visitors have complained that 
waiting to pay our parking attendant at the counter 
is very inefficient. It seems that cars are getting 
backed up when there are many shoppers trying to 
exit the parking lot at the same time. 
M:  I can understand their concern. Plus, using 
automated machines in the lot will likely save us 
more money in the long run, since we wouldn’t 
have to pay the wages of the parking attendants.
W:  Good point. Let’s bring this up to our manager at 
the staff meeting this afternoon.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Hello, Mr. Lowell. My name is Francis Foucault, and 
I’m calling from The Norwood Chronicles. Our 
paper is planning to do a series of articles on local 
entrepreneurs, and I’d like to interview you for one 
of the features. Would you be willing to do that?
M:  Most likely, but I want to know more about the 
series before committing.
W:  The articles will focus on how Portland residents 
came to own companies. Since you’re one of the 
city’s most prominent businesspeople, our readers 
would be eager to learn about your life. I’m free to 
meet with you anytime next week.
M:  In that case, yes, I’d be happy to be interviewed. 
Why don’t we meet up next Tuesday?
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Rita, it’s Dean calling from Los Angeles. Did I 
catch you at a bad time?
W:  Not at all. How is your trip going?
M:  Quite well. In fact, I’m contacting you to discuss 
my meeting with the CEO of Bower Industries. 
We’ve agreed to sign a contract.
W:  So, we’re going to distribute Bower Industries’ 
merchandise along the East Coast?
M:  Yes, beginning in May.
W:  That’s great news! Seeing as an agreement has 
now been reached, we should talk about which 
staff member will be put in charge of managing 
relations with the client.  
M:  I’ll arrange a meeting with our team about the 
matter as soon as I get back.
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  A problem has been discovered in our latest 
coffeemaker. Apparently, it overheats when it’s left 
on for more than an hour, which is a safety hazard. 
M:  Hmm . . . That’s definitely a problem. We’d better 
play it safe. Let’s instruct our engineers to begin 
working to improve the design immediately. 
W:  They’ve already been notif ied and wil l  be 
prioritizing the task over the next few days. 
Nevertheless, we should push back the product’s 
launch a week or so in order to have the flaw fixed. 
M:  I think you’re right. It doesn’t appear as though we 
have any other options. 
Questions 65-67 refer to the following conversation 
and graph.
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음	
M:  Hey, Hadley. I’d like you to lead the software 
development team when Raoul retires in two 
weeks. If you accept the position, I’ll tell our 
developers at the meeting this afternoon.
W:  Really? I’m honored that you selected me out of all 
the other candidates interested in the position. I’d 
love to take on that role. Do you know what my 
first assignment will be?
M:  Yes. You’ll be overseeing a project updating one 
of our applications.
W:  Are you referring to Music Time? I know its 
monthly downloads dropped again.
M:  No, that application has already been dealt with. 
Actually, I’m talking about the one with the greatest 
jump in downloads since May. Its code must be 
revised.
Questions 68-70 refer to the following conversation 
and label.
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	
W:  I’m going to buy an Orange Blast soda because 
the gas station shop is having a special on this 
brand. If I buy two, I’ll get one free. Do you want 
one?
M:  Can I look at the label? Hmm . . . although it 
contains a sizeable amount of vitamins, I’ll pass. 
I’m fine with the amount of fat and sodium it 
contains, but I’m trying to avoid drinks with more 
than 40 grams of this other ingredient.
W:  No problem. Is there anything else you’d like? It’s 
on me.

Questions 71-73 refer to the following speech.
캐나다식	발음
It is an incredible honor to receive the Darin Kurt 
Lifetime Achievement Award this evening. I always 
wanted to become a chef, but I never dreamt of 
leading such a long and prosperous career. While 
many people contributed to my success, I want to give 
special thanks to my mentor and friend, Mali Kaya. 
Her guidance and support has been essential. Without 
it, I never would have enrolled in culinary school or 
opened my first restaurant. So thank you, Mali. 
Questions 74-76 refer to the following telephone 
message. 
미국식	발음
Hello, Mr. James. This is Claire Washington—the new 
lead editor for your manuscript at Lilith Publications. I 
read over your latest submission this morning and 
found a major inconsistency. In chapter one, your 
main character states that she was raised on a farm, 
but she later mentions her childhood apartment. I was 
just going to tell you to simply change the apartment 
reference, but other key passages refer to it. You 
need to resolve this issue by July 9, since publication 
is scheduled for August 20. Please send me an 
updated copy as soon as possible. I don’t think it’ll 
take much time because you are familiar with the 
material and know what you meant to say.

캐나다식	발음
I would like to take a few minutes to get everyone up 
to date on our latest project. As was discussed earlier 
this quarter, I commissioned Capital Group to conduct 
a market analysis on behalf of our company. Well, the 
results from their analysis have come back, and they 
are less promising than we were expecting. As it turns 
out, our newest board game, Tagline, did not test well 
with its target consumer group. Most users thought 
the instructions were too complicated. Moreover, 
many people found Tagline to be too similar to other 
games that are already on the market. Given the 
response from consumers, I have chosen to cancel all 
future development of Tagline and channel our 
resources elsewhere. 
Questions 83-85 refer to the following news report. 
영국식	발음
This is Claudia Jordan reporting for CBIZ, your most 
trusted source of business news. Earlier today, the 
search engine provider Connexion held a press 
conference to announce that it had acquired MapPro. 
The acquisition of the satellite mapping company will 
enable Connexion to include updated maps in its 
search results. This isn’t that significant of a 
development, though. Most major search engines 
already allow their users to access this type of 
information. According to Connexion’s president 
Briana Clinton, the company has several other 
planned uses for MapPro’s technology, including a 
location-based social networking platform. We’ll now 
welcome 30-year industry veteran Jonathon Starr to 
talk more about the acquisition and what it means for 
other online companies.

호주식	발음
Good morning, and welcome to Charlottesville 
Chocolates, one of the largest chocolate producers in 
western Africa. Unlike most of our competitors, we do 
not simply take processed cocoa and turn it into 
chocolate candy. We use a unique production process 
that begins with our experts working closely with local 
farmers to select the highest-quality cocoa pods. We 
then roast the seeds in-house and use them to make 
our renowned chocolate bars that are sold all over the 
world. You’ll see most of this process today aside 
from the portion that takes place in the fermentation 
room, which is undergoing repairs. Instead, we’ll visit 
the seed harvesting area at that allotted time. Now, if 
everyone’s ready, we’ll begin.
Questions 95-97 refer to the following telephone 
message and coupon.

We’re glad that so many of you could attend the Cape 
Breton History Museum’s donors’ event tonight. After 
six months of renovations, our facility has been 
completely modernized. Before we begin, I’d like to 
express the museum’s grat i tude to Kendal l 
Construction for finishing the renovations ahead of 
schedule. At 7:45 p.m., we’ll be taking a group 
photograph in front of the temporary exhibit located 
between the Tyrannosaurus statue and the gift shop 
for tomorrow’s newspaper. Until then, you are free to 
explore the exhibits on your own. Oh, before I forget  
. . . Please take the time to fill out the visitor’s 
experience survey that one of our staff members will 
hand out now. We’d really appreciate your feedback 
on the museum.

PART 3
Questions 32-34 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  Good morning. I’m planning to take golf lessons, 
and I’d like to rent a set of clubs from your shop. I’ll 
need them for three months, starting from today. 
M:  Not a problem. Our rental prices are quite 
competit ive, and the fee includes damage 
insurance for the clubs. However, we recently 
modified our rental rules, so you’ll have to rent 
them for at least six months, which is a bit too long 
for you, I think.
W:  Hmm . . . well, that should be fine. I might want to 
practice with the clubs after the lessons are 
finished.
M:  All right. A piece of photo ID is required to rent our 
equipment, so I’ll need to look at that first.
Questions 35-37 refer to the following conversation. 
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  This launch for our firm’s GPS navigation device is 
going very well. It might be the most successful 
event that I’ve overseen since I started working as 
the manager of the product development team.
W:  Yes, a lot of technology bloggers and industry 
figures have shown up. They all seem very 
impressed with the device. Hopefully, they’ll bring 
positive attention to it as well as our firm.
M:  I think they will. In fact, I just spoke with Emily 
Scott, a staff writer from Everyday Science. She 
intends to publish a favorable review about our 
product on her company’s Web site. 
Questions 38-40 refer to the following conversation 
with three speakers.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
M1:  I’m glad you’re both here. I was just going 
through the sample we received from the printer.
W:   Do you mean the Psychology 101 textbook that 
we will publish on March 31?
M1:  Right. But we have a problem. The graph on 
page 234 was printed upside down. We will have 
to postpone publication because there are 5,000 
copies that will need to be reprinted.
M2:  You know, there was a similar situation last year, 
and the printer just replaced the page that 
contained the error. The entire process took only 
a few days.
M1:  That’s a relief. I’ll call the printer now and explain 
the situation.
W:   Actually, I have to discuss some shipping charges 
with the manager of the print shop. I’ll go there 
now and deal with this as well. 
Questions 41-43 refer to the following conversation. 
호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  This is Dennis Walden, head of The Music 
Collective. I recently hired your agency to organize 
and promote a charity concert for my foundation. 
I’m calling to see how the preparations are coming 
along. 
W:  For the most part, things are going well, Mr. Walden. 
However, the band that you want to book will be 
performing elsewhere on the night of the event. 
So, I’m afraid they can’t participate. 
M:  Hmm. In that case, why don’t you see if The Sifters 
are available? They played at one of our fundraising 
banquets last year, and everyone seemed to enjoy 
their music. You should get in touch with them. 
Questions 44-46 refer to the following conversation.
영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음
W:  Sorry I’m a few minutes late, but it took me almost 
two hours to drive to the office today. Traffic on the 
freeway was extremely slow.
M:  Really? I can’t believe it took you so long. Why 
don’t you just use public transportation? I’m sure it 
would be a lot faster than driving.
W:  Well, the nearest subway or bus station from my 
apartment is 20 minutes on foot. With the cold 
weather here, I prefer not to walk. So, I usually 
end up taking my car.
M:  Actually, the Transport Authority just changed its 
city bus routes. I think bus 402 now stops in your 
neighborhood, so that would be really convenient 
for you. I’ll forward you a link to the city Web site for 
you to review.
Questions 47-49 refer to the following conversation.
캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음
M:  Rochester Convention Center. How can I help you?
W:  Good morning. I’m calling about the Bridgeport 
Auto Show on May 18. I know that tickets are $20 
per person, but I will be attending with the other 
members of my auto club. Is it possible for us to get 
a group rate?
M:  Yes. But you’ll need to discuss it with Carol 
Humphrey who is in charge of group ticket sales. 
Her e-mail address is carol@conventionpro.com.
W:  Great. We’re really excited about the upcoming 
exhibit of antique cars.
M:  We have some brochures from the company that 
is organizing that event. If you’d like, I can send 
one to you.
W:  Thanks, but that’s not necessary. I already have 
one.

Questions 50-52 refer to the following conversation. 
영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  I heard that you just returned from your business 
trip to Cape Town, South Africa. How did it go?
M:  Everything related to work went well, but the rest 
of my time there was a bit disappointing. It rained 
throughout my stay, so I didn’t get a chance to 
walk around the city.
W:  That’s a shame. Cape Town has various public 
parks and some really beautiful monuments. I 
suppose you weren’t able to see any of them.
M:  No, I had to spend most of my free time in my 
hotel room. Hopefully, I’ll get a chance to return in 
the future and tour the area. 
Questions 53-55 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	
W:  A few of the convention attendees are curious 
whether video or audio clips of today’s talks will be 
posted online. Do you know if that is going to 
happen?
M:  Only some of them will be shared following the 
event. Is there a particular lecture that people are 
inquiring about?
W:  Yes, a number of attendees have asked about 
Lillian Kraft’s talk on investing in foreign markets. 
Many of them seem to have been quite impressed.
M:  She is the keynote speaker, so video clips 
including her talk will definitely be uploaded to the 
Web site. You can inform anyone who inquires 
about it that they will be able to access them later 
on.
Questions 56-58 refer to the following conversation.
호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Felicity Gifford, who is one of the students coming 
to the library for today’s job search workshop, uses 
a wheelchair. We need to make sure she’s able to 
comfortably pull her wheelchair up to a table.
W:  Nick and I can take care of that, since we’re 
planning to shift some of the furniture around 
anyway. More people than anticipated registered 
for the class, so the tables and chairs must be 
rearranged to make better use of the space.
M:  All right. Also, if a lot of people are coming, we 
should have one of our staff members welcome 
participants at the front door and help them find their 
seats.
Questions 59-61 refer to the following conversation.
미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음
W:  I’m looking for someone to do some graphic work, 
and another member of our community association 
told me that you are a designer. But I thought that 
you work at a law firm.
M:  Yes, I’m a legal assistant at Beale and Associates 
here in town. However, I do freelance graphic 
design to make extra money on the side. What type 
of work is it? 
W:  Well, a poster needs to be created for our 
organization. It will be placed in coffee houses 
around the neighborhood to draw in more people 
to our weekly meetings. Would you be willing to 
make it? 
M:  Of course! I’d be happy to volunteer my time to the 
association. I’ll begin working on it this evening. 
Questions 62-64 refer to the following conversation 
and table.
캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음
M:  Thank you for calling EZ Home Cleaning. What 
can I assist you with today?
W:  My uncle referred me to your company, and I’m 
interested in your services. I need my floors 
vacuumed and the surfaces of my desk and 
bookshelves dusted. Also, I’d like my laundry 
washed. 
M:  Your first two requests can be accommodated, but 
we don’t offer the third service you mentioned. If 
you want your windows cleaned as well, that will 
only cost an additional $90. 
W:  That sounds compelling, but I’ll pass. 
M:  That’s fine. Well, the next step is scheduling an 
on-site consultation, as our prices depend on how 
big your house is. Would this weekend be 
convenient?
W:  Sure. Saturday at 1 p.m. works for me.

M:  Hello, this is Jack Parker. I made a reservation for 
Friday at 12:30 p.m., but I’d like to move it to the 
evening . . . um . . . to 6:00 p.m. Some important 
clients will be at our office for a presentation that 
afternoon, and I will need to participate.
W:  No problem, Mr. Parker. And just to let you know, 
we recently updated our menu, and there are 
several new entrées available.
M:  I saw that on your Web site when I downloaded a 
coupon this morning.
W:  The one for a free entrée? Actually, you won’t be 
able to use that with your reservation. I’m sorry 
about that.
M:  Oh . . . yeah, I see what the problem is. I’ll just use 
it some other time.

M:  Yep. Could you put some bamboo shoots in these

arrive.
W:  No problem. 
M:  And after that, please head over to the enclosure 
where the pandas will be kept and check whether 
it’s clean. If not, we should hose it down this 
afternoon.
W:  Do you mean the enclosure near the back exit on 
Lee Drive or the one at the intersection of Taylor

M:  I’m talking about the latter one.

호주식	발음
Welcome to the annual South Hill Library Book Fair. 
Each autumn, we host a variety of special activities to 
encourage reading among local residents. In addition 
to offering a vast variety of both new and used books 
for sale, we are pleased to present a special event 
this year—an exhibition of rare first-edition books by 
early American authors. These publications are on 
loan from the University of Minneapolis and will be 
displayed in the lobby for the duration of the fair. And I 
would like to thank this year’s corporate sponsor, 
Camdale Enterprises, for their financial support.
Questions 74-76 refer to the following radio broadcast.
캐나다식	발음
You’re listening to WRP 99.9. The annual fireworks 
festival is set to take place tomorrow evening, much to 
the delight of many Harrisburg locals. This celebration 
has been a local attraction for 20 years now and will 
feature fireworks presentations created by seven 
different countries. That’s right—an addition has been 
made to the usual six countries, with Germany making 
its fireworks debut in Harrisburg this year. And those 
looking to join in tomorrow’s festivities should note 
that the festival will now be held in Mayberry Park by 
the banks of Britstone River. The announcement was 
made by city hall this afternoon due to somewhat 
unanticipated concerns regarding potential fire 
hazards at the previously selected venue, Kenton 
Lake. Now, stay tuned for the weekend weather 
forecast.
Questions 77-79 refer to the following announcement.

Before we explore the Chakra Wildlife Park, I want 
you to listen closely to the following instructions and 
information. First, food is not permitted inside the 
park. Second, photographs are allowed, but please do 
not use a flash because the light scares the animals. 
Third, do not exit the shuttle at any time during the 
tour. As a reminder, there will be an hour lunch break 
at the Jungle Café after we’re done touring the African

Hello, Kathryn. This is James Hartman from the 
editorial office. I’m calling to let you know that the 
human resources department just notified me that 
they’ve approved your leave request. However, your 
article on extreme sports activities must be finished 
before you leave the office on Friday. This is very 
important, as the piece is going to be included in next 
month’s magazine edition. Also, your team member, 
Joanne Marr, is going to take over responsibility for 
your other work while you’re away. So, please share 
any materials that you have already compiled for your 
assignments with her. Feel free to drop by my office if 
you have any questions. Otherwise, we’ll talk again 
when you return.

It is my pleasure to welcome you all to the opening 
day of Keller University’s scientific lecture series. We 
have invited a variety of scientific experts from the 
fields of biology, chemistry, and physics to elaborate 
on their most current studies and findings. I am sure 
you will find all four of today’s talks very educational. I 
encourage everyone to pick up programs for today’s 
event at the information booth near the main entrance. 
Also, we request that you wait until the conclusion of 
each lecture to ask questions. Each speaker will have 
an opportunity to address inquiries following his or her 
talk. Thank you, and I hope you enjoy the event.

Hello, Ms. Cooper. This is Trevor from Fairfield Travel 
returning your call about a last-minute flight to Paris 
tomorrow. I could only find you two options. I can book 
you on the earliest available direct flight, which . . . um 
. . . which leaves at 7 p.m. and arrives at 2 a.m. The 
other option is a flight departing at 1:00 p.m. that will 
get you there at 11:00 p.m., but it has a three-hour 
layover in Brussels. I know neither is ideal, but 
unfortunately there were no morning departures as 
you had requested. I’ll be meeting with another client 
until noon, so call me back anytime after that to let me 
know which flight you’d prefer. Thank you.

Good morning. I’m Sandra Choi with Channel 11 
News. On Saturday, August 3, an organization called 
Our Natural Resources will be holding a five-kilometer 
run in Chicago. The goal of the event is to raise funds 
for the maintenance of public parks around the city. 
Organizers expect thousands of people to participate 
in the race and hope to generate nearly one million 
dollars. Online registration for the run will remain open 
until August 1, so there are still three weeks to sign up. 
Financial contributions are also being accepted from 
those who cannot attend the event but would like to 
offer support.

There is one more matter to discuss during today’s 
board meeting . . . our new Glide cell phone. It looks 
like the sales team was right about our customers 
wanting a phone with a smaller screen. It’s been an 
amazing success since its second quarter release. 
Our concerns about a smaller, more expensive phone 
not being able to compete with cheaper models were 
clearly misguided. Not only has it outsold our budget 
model for three straight quarters, but it also eclipsed 
our larger, top-of-the-line model during the last quarter 
to become our second-highest-selling phone. If its 
sales continue to increase, the Glide will soon be our 
best-selling model.
