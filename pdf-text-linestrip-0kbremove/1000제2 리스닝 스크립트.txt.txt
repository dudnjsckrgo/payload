Questions	32-34	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Hi, Mark. I heard you were asked to travel with the 
marketing and sales team members to Tokyo next 
week. 

M:  That’s right. Our CEO thinks we may have to make a 
few last-minute changes to the contract with the local 
company that will distribute our products. So, he 
wants someone from the legal department to go 
along. Oh, that reminds me . . . I paid for my flight 
and hotel with my personal credit card. Do you know 
where I can get information about the reimbursement 
process?

W:  You should read the guide posted on the company 
intranet by the accounting team. It includes detailed 
instructions.

M:  Thanks. I’ll do that right away.

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Excuse me. I watched a play here on May 19, and  
I believe I left my watch in the bathroom. I took it off 
when I was washing my hands. Has anyone turned 
one in?

W:  Actually, yes. But I need to confirm that you are the 
owner. Um, could you tell me what your watch looks 
like?

M:  Sure. It has a steel case and a leather strap. And, uh, 
if you look at the back, you will see that my name is 
inscribed . . . um, James Higgs.

W:  Well, Mr. Higgs, you are in luck! If I can just see your 
driver’s license or another piece of photo ID,  
I can give you your watch back.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음	 	

M:  Sarah, the projector in the conference room doesn’t 
seem to be working. Could you call a technician?

W:  I already did . . . Someone from the tech team will be 
here at 3 or 3:30 p.m.

M:  But I have to give a presentation to our department 
head at 2. Is there any way a technician could come 
earlier?

W:  I don’t think so . . . That team is really busy today. 
M:  I’m not sure what to do, then. All the other rooms are 

booked.
W:  Um, I think the one on the second floor might be 

available at that time. The workshop that was going 
to be held there was rescheduled. You should book it 
right away, though.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation	with	
three	speakers.
	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음→	영국식	발음	

M:   Elena, Patricia! It’s so nice to see you both. You’re a 
bit early, though. Dan’s birthday party doesn’t 
officially begin until 4 p.m. 

W1:  We know it’s only 3 o’clock, but we thought we 
would come a bit early to lend a hand.

W2:  Yeah. We figured you might need some help 
preparing food and decorating. Hopefully, we’re not 
intruding. 

M:   Not at all! In fact, I’m glad you’re here. I’m running a 
bit behind, so this is great. 

W2: Well, what can we do?
M:   Why don’t you two chop up the tomatoes and 

onions in the kitchen for fresh salsa? While you do 
that, I’ll set the table.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  Thanks for inviting me today. The Stallions are my 
favorite baseball team, but I rarely get a chance to go 
to their games. This is a lot of fun.  

M:  My pleasure. A coworker of mine has season tickets 
for all of the home games. He’s out of town this 
weekend, so he gave me his tickets.

W:  That was very generous of him. Well, I’m going to 
grab some snacks. Do you need anything?

M:  I’ve got a hot dog and soda.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Bellport Florist, Gerald speaking. How can I help you 
today?

W:  I’m interested in buying flowers for a coworker. She’s 
been selected as the employee of the month and will 
be presented with an award during a ceremony 
tomorrow morning. So, I need to pick the flowers up 
this afternoon. 

M:  That shouldn’t be a problem. Is there a particular kind 
of flower you’d like to get? 

W:  Yes. Orchids are her favorite flower, so a bouquet of 
those, please.  

M:  Oh . . . I’m very sorry, but we ran out of those this 
morning. We don’t expect another shipment until 
Saturday. However, our branch in Hereford might 
have some available. I suggest that you give them a 
call.

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	

M:  I have a suggestion for decorating this lobby. Why 
don’t we choose furniture that complements the blue 
and green wallpaper we have used throughout the 
hotel? 

W:  Good idea. We’ll definitely need several couches. 
And they should be made of leather as that material 
is very durable. Why don’t we look at some from 
West Loop?

M:  West Loop mostly sells items that are suitable for 
private residences. But, um . . . Bently Furniture 
specializes in commercial furniture.

W:  Yeah, I suppose so. In that case, I’ll call that store to 
find out whether they have any leather sofas in stock.

W:  Hello, sir. How can I help you this morning?
M:  I need to travel to Berlin. I know a train on the Red 

Line regularly heads there from Bonn. When does 
the next one leave?

W:  The next one won’t leave for about two hours. 
M:  I’d like a ticket for that one. I can call some of my 

clients while I wait. 
W:  Certainly. It’ll be €75. By the way, I encourage you to 

make use of our lounge. It offers comfortable chairs, 
free wireless Internet, and vending machines. It’s just 
down the hallway to your left.

Questions	56-58	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	

W:  I’m glad I’ve bumped into you. I’m wondering how the 
report you’re working on is coming along. The one 
about the risk analysis of the South American 
consumer markets that we’re considering entering.

M:  I finished it two hours ago.
W:  Could you e-mail it to me, then? Tomorrow, I’ll be 

meeting with Fred Diamond, a major investor in our 
clothing firm. He wants to discuss our plan.

M:  Actually, I already sent it. I figured you already knew. 
W:  Oh, I must have overlooked that e-mail. I’ll check for 

it again and contact you if I have questions about the 
report. 

Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Mayor Lamar, thank you for joining me on this 
episode of Happening Today. We’ll spend most of 
the hour talking about your work as a civil rights 
lawyer before being elected earlier this year. 
However, I believe you have some news to share 
before we get into that.

W:  Yes. I’m very pleased to announce that, after working 
with the city council, I’ve been able to secure over $5 
million in additional funding for the city’s schools next 
year. It’s my first major accomplishment as the mayor 
of Chicago.

M:  And how will the funds be used?
W:  City schools will be getting additional books, art 

materials, and furniture.

Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
highway	map.
	 미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  Paul, it’s Wendy. I’m wondering how far away you 
are from the office. The gathering to welcome our 
new branch manager doesn’t start for another hour, 
but I’d like to talk to you about the training workshop 
we’re holding for the accounting staff next week.

M:  Not too far. I just pulled off the highway, and I am 
passing Sun Market now. I should be there in 15 
minutes or so.

W:  OK, great. That’ l l  give us a chance to chat 
beforehand.

M:  Sounds good. By the way, do you need me to get 

any last-minute supplies? Are there enough drinks 
for everyone?

W:  Thanks, but that’s not necessary. 

Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
shelving	unit.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Pardon me. I’d like to buy my nephew a laptop. He’s 
going to college soon, and he’ll need one to write 
papers.

W:  Sure thing. Are there any particular features you 
have in mind?

M:  I know he likes to have many windows open at once, 
so a wider screen would be best. I’m leaning toward 
the C34, but I’m not certain.

W:  While the C34 is a great model, it’s intended for video 
editing. I’m guessing it’s more powerful than 
necessary. 

M:  Yeah, good point. 
W:  However, the device just below that one is the same 

size. Although less powerful than the C34, it’s ideal 
for running word processing programs. It’s also much 
cheaper.

Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
sign.	
	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Charlotte, did you hear that our IT company will be 
hosting a volunteer day? Management is hoping it’ll 
attract some positive media attention, and all of the 
technicians are encouraged to participate. I’m really 
looking forward to it. 

W:  Yeah, me too. I guess we’ll be tutoring students at 
local schools.

M:  It’s a great idea, but I’m a bit surprised by some of 
the goals. Uh, 20 people from our newest office are 
expected to take part, but there are only 30 
employees. 

W:  I’m sure that office will meet its goal. And I’m going to 
sign up now. I want to make sure that our branch has 
enough volunteers.

M:  Good point. I’ll join you.

May I have your attention, please? This is just a reminder

spend at least $20 in the store. When you leave our

Good morning. Department head Louise Shah has asked 
me to tell you a little about myself since this is my first 
day here. Well . . . ah . . . before taking this job as an 
administrative assistant, I was an intern at the legal office 
of Patel & Ashwin. This is actually my first experience 
working at an import-export company, so it might take 
some time to get used to everything here. Anyway, I’m

How’s everyone enjoying the music so far? Um, our next 
performer is making his second appearance at the Salem 
Blues Festival. He was here seven years ago—the very 
first time this event was held—and his performance was 
one of the festival’s highlights. At that time, Philip 
Waterfield was accompanied by five bandmates, but 
today he’ll be appearing on stage all by himself to 
promote his record, which came out in April. He doesn’t 
play live much anymore, so this is certainly a special 
occasion. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together 
for Mr. Waterfield.

This message is for Blong Vang in response to his recent 
inquiry regarding his reservation with StarQuest Voyages. 
Mr. Vang, our records indicate that there might be a 
problem with the cruise you booked for June 14 to 21. 
You asked for a Standard cabin, which includes a twin-
size bed. However, in the “special request” section, you 
left a note saying that you require a queen-size mattress. 
Well, Premier cabins include queen-size beds. Images of 
these accommodations are included in the digital 
brochure e-mailed to you last week. If this cabin type is 
satisfactory, please let us know as soon as possible so 
that your booking and billing statement can be updated.

Attention, please. Due to technical difficulties with our 
sound system, there’s going to be a change to today’s 
main event at the Recreational Fishing Expo. Shawn 
Murray, the host of the television show Catch and 
Release, will still appear at the scheduled time of  
2:30 p.m. However, his talk on the impact of technology 
on amateur fishing will be taking place in the ballroom 
rather than the auditorium. If you want to get a seat, you 
may want to head to the ballroom 10 or 15 minutes 
beforehand. Otherwise, there should be plenty of 
standing room. Thanks for your understanding.

People commuting on the Calgary subway system this 
morning have been dealing with delays ever since a train 
broke down between Bowness Station and Edgemont 
Station. For over 30 minutes now, trains have not been 
able to run on the Blue Line. According to the city 
transportation authority, an electrical failure is to blame 
for the situation. Technicians have been sent to the 
location, and we are hoping to get things back to normal 
soon. Now let’s turn to Laura Goodman for a morning 
business news update.

OK, everyone, please gather around. This room marks 
the final portion of your tour of author Leo Edmund’s 
house. As you can see, this was his personal office, and 
he completed a fair amount of his writing here. As with 
the living room, bedrooms, and dining room, this is a very 
modest space considering Mr. Edmund’s wealth. The 
only exception is the fine leather armchairs, which are 
actually quite famous. They were gifted to Mr. Edmund by 
King Ferdinand in 1877. Now, on the desk under some 
protective glass, you’ll notice a few pages from Mr. 
Edmund’s journal. I suggest taking a look at them.

Samuel, it’s Clarisa. My grandfather asked me to drive 
him to a doctor’s appointment in the late afternoon. So 
I’m not going to be at Andrea’s house early enough 
tomorrow to help you prepare for her birthday party. 
Fortunately, hanging decorations in the living room 
shouldn’t take more than half an hour. As for the drink  
I was going to make, Andrea has a copy of the recipe. 
Only, I use 30 milliliters of pineapple juice and also add 
cubed watermelon. I suggest doing the same. It really 
improves the flavor. Just call me if you have any

Next Sunday is our art gallery’s 20th anniversary, and  
I want to celebrate this milestone by honoring artists who 
have been crucial to our success along the way. That’s

because I want to report an error in your newspaper.

M:  What mistake did you discover, Ms. Johnson?
W:  Well . . . I’m the owner of the vitamin and supplement 

store called Lancaster Health and Nutrition. Yesterday, 
you published an article about our new branch that’s 
going to open in Dalton Plaza next week. But the 
article said it’s opening next month.

M:  Oh, I’m very sorry. I’ll be certain to notify our news 
editor immediately. Once he verifies the misprint, I’m 
sure he’ll arrange for a correction to be posted in 
tomorrow’s edition.

W:  It appears that we need more meals for tonight’s 
year-end, corporate dinner party. Seven of our 
employees brought additional guests, but the cooks 
only prepared enough food for the confirmed number 
of guests.  

M:  Hmm, that’s odd. I was in charge of keeping track of 
the guest list, and just one person contacted me 
today to say that he was bringing an extra person 
with him.

W:  Maybe some of them changed their minds at the last 
minute. Anyway, could you ask the chef to make a 
few more dishes?

M:  Sure. I’ll head to the kitchen and find out if he can do 
that.

M:  Shannon, I noticed that you ride your bike to work. 
Did you know that some of the people in our 
department have formed a bicycle group? 

W:  Really? I hadn’t heard that. Can you tell me more 
about it?

M:  Well, we meet every Saturday and go on long rides 
together. Some of us just enjoy the workout, while 
others are training for competitive events. Of course, 
participating in these races isn’t a requirement for 
club members.

W:  That’s a relief. I’m not very experienced. But I do like 
the idea of getting some exercise. How do I join?

M:  I’ll e-mail you the registration form this afternoon.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

M:  After this morning’s new recruit orientation, you said 
that you’d provide me with a list of the names of the 
new employees from each department. But the one 
you sent me was from the last orientation instead. 

W:  Sorry about that. Is it OK if I get you the correct one 
later? I must go to an important lunch meeting with 
the funders of our new building project right now, so  
I don’t have enough time at the moment.

M:  That’s fine. Just remember to get it to me before you 
leave the office today. I’ll need to enter their contact 
information into our database before I publish the new 
employee directory on Wednesday. 

W:  I won’t forget.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  You want to see me, Ms. Collins?
W:  Yes. Many customers have provided negative 

feedback about the XLNC solar clocks. I’m a little 
worried. They say their machines aren’t charging 
properly, which causes them to stop functioning after 
just a few days.

M:  Bill Johnson from our engineering team and I recently 
tested 200 random units. They all worked perfectly. 
So, my guess is that consumers aren’t using the 
devices properly. I think we need to clarify our user 
manual.

W:  I see. We should also post information about it on our 
Web site. Can you please make a draft of that?

M:  OK. When do you want this done by?
W:  Early enough so that I can skim through it before my 

shift ends today.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

M:  Excuse me. I require some assistance. I’d like you to 
print 100 wedding invitations for me, but I’m not sure 
which type of paper to use. I want the invitations to 
look nice but also be durable. Do you have any 
recommendations?

W:  I suggest trying our store’s glossy card stock. This 
high-quality paper is very strong, so it doesn’t tear 
easily. It’d be ideal if you intend to deliver the 
invitations through the mail. 

M:  That sounds perfect. How much will the order cost? 
W:  Well, each sheet of card stock costs 50¢ to print, and 

you can fit two invitations per sheet . . . So, your 
grand total will be $25.

M:  Hello. I read about the fitness courses your business 
offers in a flyer. I’m interested in the weight-training 
class. When is it held?

W:  That one is held once a week on Saturday, from  
9 a.m. to 1 p.m. in our largest room. We used to offer a 
second session at 7 p.m., but not many people signed 
up, so we decided to cancel it.

W:  Hello. My name is Annabel Christiansen. I’m here to 
check in for the 5:40 p.m. flight to London. I have my 
passport and ticket here.

M:  I’m sorry. You’ve arrived too late, Ms. Christiansen. 
Check-in for that flight closed 20 minutes ago. There 
won’t be enough time for you to reach the gate before 
takeoff.

W:  Oh, no. I was worried this was going to happen, 
seeing as my taxi was stuck in traffic on the way 
here. Are there any other flights today that I can take 
instead?

M:  Yes, we still have seats available on the one that 
leaves at 10:30 p.m. For a $100 fee, I can update 
your reservation and issue you another ticket.

M:  Hello, Ms. Law. My name is Lance Graner, and  
I am organizing a conference in April for young 
professionals who are just entering the field of 
finance. As you are an investment consultant for a 
respected firm, I am calling to offer you a paid 
speaking opportunity at the conference.

W:  Well, I’ll be unavailable in early April as I’m planning to 
visit one of our offices abroad during that time. 
However, as long as the event takes place after April

W:  Mathew, it’s Claudia. Something unexpected came 
up, so I won’t be able to meet to talk about the 
billboard design today. 

M:  If you have a minute, we could just discuss it now.
W:  Sure.
M:  OK. So, how do you like the first draft that I sent you?
W:  The font is great. My only concern is how the 

information is arranged. Personally, I think we should 
switch the positions of the address and the slogan. It 
would be better if the slogan appeared directly under 
the company name. The date is fine where it is, 
though.

M:  That’s a simple change. I can make it and e-mail you 
the revised version sometime this afternoon.

numbers, and /the restaurant was fully booked last 
weekend.

M:  Yeah. And many of the people who came said they 
were going to post about our restaurant on their 
social networking pages. That’s great publicity.

W:  Also, our publicist, Harold Newman, will be appearing 
on Morning Buzz tomorrow. That will be sure to help 
us gain even more positive public attention.

M:  That’s great. A lot of people in the area watch that

going?

W:  There was a mix-up with our food supplier. Only half

morning. 

M:  Oh, no. Do you want me to go buy the ingredients we 
need?

W:  OK. Here’s a list of everything I require. Oh, hold on .

pounds of carrots. The amounts for the onions and 
the others are correct though.

Good afternoon, Mr. Jackson. This is Claudia Omar, from 
Proactive Insurance, responding to the voice mail you left 
me yesterday. You mentioned you’d like to learn more 
about motorcycle insurance. Well, our most popular plan 
is the Platinum Protection package, which provides you 
up to $250,000 in coverage, and I think it would be your 
best choice. The premium for the plan varies considerably 
depending on the motorbike you have, so I’ll need to 
know the brand and model of your bike before I can give 
you an accurate quote. Please call me back today with 
those details if you can. Thanks.

In business news, the multinational technology company 
Core Resources has announced that its CEO, Kerry 
Rose, will be stepping down from her position at the end 
of May. Under Ms. Rose’s leadership, the company grew 
to be the world’s third-largest software developer. It had 
under 8,000 workers when she started, while it currently 
employs about 15,000 staff members. Although Core 
Resources has yet to release her replacement’s name to 
the public—and most likely won’t do so until closer to Ms. 
Rose’s departure—some analysts are speculating about 
who the next leader of the company might be. One widely 
discussed candidate is Dale Fenny, the company’s 
current chief financial officer.

I suspected that The Time Was Then was going to do 
well, I never guessed it would break international box

film deserves a huge amount of credit. What’s more,  
I want to give a special thanks to Gabriela Hernandez, 
who taught me everything I know about this art form.

Stay tuned for Carl Lewis’s Daily Business Report. 
Joining Carl tonight for a rare television interview will be 
Francine Austen. She is the managing editor of the 
fashion and design publication Currents. They’re going to 
talk about the online version of the magazine that was 
launched earlier this year. It has proven to be very 
successful as the number of new subscribers to Currents 
increased for two consecutive months after the site 
became active. This success is attributed to Ms. Austen’s 
development of a subscription model that provides 
access to the print and digital versions for one low fee. 
They’ll discuss this in depth when we return from a short 
commercial break.

Hello. My name is Alice Warren, and I’m registered for 
the student employment workshop that will be held at the 
Westwood Employment Center on Saturday. I’m very 
excited about this because I plan to begin searching for a 
summer internship in early May, once I’ve finished my 
final exams at the end of April. But there’s one problem  
. . . I have to meet with my professor to discuss an 
assignment that day. Um, it slipped my mind when I 
signed up for the workshop yesterday. Would it be a 
problem if I skipped one of the sessions? I would leave at 
noon and be back just after two. Please call me at 555-
4938 to let me know if this is allowed. Thanks.

W:  Thank you for calling Palmer and Sons. How can  
I help you? 

M:  My name is Brent Miller, and I placed an order late 
last week to have a custom frame made for a picture 
I took. I’m wondering if I can come pick it up this 
afternoon. 

W:  Unfortunately not, Mr. Miller. I’m running behind 
schedule, so I’ve had to postpone working on your 
order until tomorrow afternoon. I apologize for the 
inconvenience. 

M:  That’s OK. I don’t need it until next week, so 
tomorrow is fine. I can stop by on my way home from 
work in the evening.

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

M:  I see that you’re looking at our store’s newest 
collection of speakers. Do you have any questions 
about the products? If so, I’d be happy to answer 
them. 

W:  I’m interested in buying a speaker for my friend as a 
gift. He wants a portable one to connect to his cell 
phone. Do you have something matching that 
description? 

M:  I recommend the Tide EX. It’s designed specifically 
for cell phones. It’s lightweight and even has wireless 
capabilities. Plus, we are offering it at 10 percent off 
the regular price this week.

W:  Thanks for the suggestion. I’ll go and take a look at it 
now.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	

W:  Hello, Hans. This is Karen. As you already know, Jim 
Bates is stepping down as head copywriter at the end 
of this month. That means we’ll have to move 
someone into his position. Who do you think would be 
a good candidate?

M:  Personally, I’m in favor of Richard Hammel. He’s 
been a dedicated employee for 10 years. He’s written 
the text for a variety of advertisements for us and 
seems to understand all aspects of the job. What do 
you think?

W:  I have several candidates in mind. Hammel is one of 
them. Can you meet me in the conference room in 
two hours? I’d like to talk about this matter further.

M:  Sure thing. See you then.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation	with	
three	speakers.
	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	

W1:  This is Emily Baker in Suite 324. I’d like to book one 
of the excursions listed in the resort’s guest guide. 
Can you do that for me?

M:   Molly Branson is our activities manager. I’ll transfer 
you to her now. 

W1:  No problem.
W2:  Hello, Ms. Baker. I’m Molly. Brian says you’d like to 

join an excursion. We offer a great variety of options 
such as tours of historic Holston City, guided hikes, 
and fishing trips.

W1:  I’m interested in the Holston City tour. However, 
while your brochure says groups leave daily at  
9 a.m., nothing is mentioned about when they return.

W2:  They get back around 3 p.m.
W1:  Perfect. Can you sign me up for tomorrow?

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	

M:  Now that I’m in charge of the company’s occupational 
safety department, I’ve got to give a safety seminar to 
some of our construction workers. Do we have any 
instructional videos that I can use?

W:  Quite a few. What type of video do you want to 
show?

M:  One featuring precautionary measures at building 
sites.

W:  Oh, yeah. I bought a series of training videos last 
year. One of them deals with that topic. 

M:  It’d be great if you could send that one to me soon.
W:  They’re on my work computer, but the files are too 

large to e-mail. So I’ll post them on our online board for 
you to access.

M:  That works for me.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Cliff, it’s Rita calling from Shine Realty. Has Unit 219 
been cleaned and repainted yet in preparation for the 
new renters? 

M:  I’m afraid it hasn’t. The property has been thoroughly 
cleaned, but one of our painters accidentally bought 
the wrong paint color. So, they aren’t able to paint the 
apartment yet.

W:  Well, the new tenants are moving in on April 1, which 
is only five days away. It’s essential that everything 
be taken care of before then.

M:  I spoke to the head painter this morning, and he 
assured me the apartment would be fully ready within 
the next three days. There shouldn’t be anything to 
worry about. 

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

M:  Our company is releasing a new line of light bulbs 
next month. We’ve been assigned to create an

the letters l, e, and d in bold to refer to our  
light-emitting diode products pictured in the ads.  

W:  It’s short and clever, but I don’t think it highlights our 
product’s competitive attributes enough. Do you have 
any other ideas?

M:  I also came up with the slogan “bright lights, small 
impact” because our lights have less of a negative 
effect on the environment than regular light bulbs do.

W:  I think we should go with that slogan. Let’s bring it up 
to our supervisor at the staff meeting later today and 
see what his opinion is.

M:  Hi. The recreational baseball team that I play on 
needs a banner for an upcoming tournament. Here is 
what it should look like. 

W:  Let’s see . . . The Panthers? Wait, didn’t I make a 
banner for your team a few months ago . . . one with 
a blue and green stripe along the bottom?

M:  Yes. But last week there was a storm, and the banner 
was pulled off the fence by the wind. It has a big tear 
in it now.

W:  Oh, what a shame. I can have a new one ready by 
Friday. But, um, before you leave . . . Why don’t  
I show you how to securely attach a banner to a 
fence? That way you can avoid similar issues in the 
future.

M:  Jennifer, I’ve reviewed the product brochure draft for 
the trade show. It looks good on the whole, but  
I think we should slightly increase the size of our 
logo. It’s rather small compared to everything else, 
and I wanna make sure that it really stands out. 

W:  Certainly, Mr. Harris. That shouldn’t be difficult to fix. 
I can print out a copy of the updated brochure and 
bring it back to your office in about an hour. Is there 
anything else you want changed?

M:  No, I think that’s all. However, I have a doctor’s 
appointment just before lunchtime, so leave the 
brochure with my assistant.

	 캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M1:   Do you wanna join me this Friday for an event? 
Gallery Blue is holding a show of the latest work of 
sculptor Kerry Marx then.

M2:   Sure. I’m quite fond of her sculptures. When should 
we head there?

M1:   How does 7 p.m. sound? If you want, we can grab 
dinner beforehand as well.

M2:   That sounds good. Ellen, would you like to come, 
too?

W:   I’m working late on Friday. However, I have a gift 
certificate for Harris Kitchen that I can give you. It 
expires on Saturday, so someone should use it.  

M1:   That’d be great, Ellen. Harris Kitchen is in the vicinity 
of the gallery.

W:   Wonderful. Well, I’ll get you the certificate tomorrow.

M:  Hi, Sarah. Our team leader mentioned that you are 
organizing the retirement planning seminar for our 
bank’s clients. How’s it going?

W:  Good. Donald Sawyer just confirmed that he will give 
a presentation.

M:  That’s great. His book on investing was a best-seller. 
Um, have you selected a venue?

W:  I’ve decided on the Bridgeport Convention Hall. It has 
two meeting rooms large enough to accommodate 
the 180 people who I estimate will sign up. I just need 
to choose between a theater or classroom layout.

M:  The classroom layout would be best, in my opinion. 
Having tables would make it easier for attendees to 
take notes.

Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and

	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	

M:  Marie, an error was discovered on the time sheet you 
submitted last Thursday.

W:  Really? What seems to be the issue? 
M:  Wendy from the accounting department says you 

entered more than the maximum allowed hours per 
month.

W:  How odd. I’m fairly sure I wrote 200 hours on the 
sheet, but maybe I’m wrong. 

M:  Perhaps. Anyway, you’ll have to submit a revised 
timecard. Also, Wendy usually handles such 
information, but she and Robert are on a business 
trip together this week. So you should call the human 
resources manager to find out whom to submit the 
document to.

W:  All right. And sorry about the problem. I’ll be sure not 
to let it happen again.

M:  Later this afternoon, I want our crew leaders to get 
together to be briefed on Fillmore Stadium, which is 
the next building our firm is going to renovate.

W:  Some of the crew leaders have been asking about 
when work on the stadium is set to begin, so they’ll 
be eager to learn more.

M:  Good. I’m also gonna bring up comments a recent 
client shared with us. Aside from cleanliness—which 
I’ve already talked about to supervisors—her 
feedback highlights a less-than-ideal aspect of our 
service that I need to talk about.

W:  OK. Well, I’ll post a memo about it this afternoon on 
our online board.

M:  Thanks. Oh . . . and please schedule the meeting for

This is Katie Jackson on T T Radio 96.1 FM, and it’s time 
for your morning traffic report. Drivers heading into the 
downtown area should take note that there is heavy 
traffic on the Bayport Bridge. There was a collision 
involving three cars approximately 20 minutes ago at the 
south entrance to the bridge, resulting in the closure of 
two of the northbound lanes. Elsewhere, workers are 
conducting routine repair work on the Harborview 
Expressway, which is the other main road into the city’s 
business district. Motorists should expect delays of up to 
40 minutes. Clearing these backups will take about two 
hours. In the meantime, it would be best to commute by 
subway this morning.

Welcome, everyone, to this orientation session for our

Hello, Ms. Hollandale. This is Shawn Reardon, your tax 
adviser, calling about your annual tax return. I was just 
going through the documents you provided, and  
I realized that some figures are missing. Specifically,  
I don’t have any information about the income you earned 
as a freelance photographer. These earnings obviously 
have to be included in your tax return. Could you please 
e-mail me copies of the receipts that you issued to your 
clients last year? I won’t be able to file your state and 
federal tax forms until you’ve done this. Thank you.

I want to express how much we at Green Renewal 
appreciate all of you donating your time and energy to help 
us remove waste from the grounds of Pine Park. Your task 
this morning is to walk around the park and pick up the 
litter that accumulated throughout the winter. You’ll be 
doing this in groups of four, each of which will be assigned 
to a specific area. We’d better get started right away. As 
you can see, the park is quite large. If you all follow me to 
the van parked next to that row of flowers, I’ll give the 
necessary equipment to everyone.

Thank you for attending the Corbyn Film Festival. 
Although this is our organization’s first festival, we hope 
to hold many more in the future. Over the course of the 
next three days, 20 films from around the world will be 
screened, including ones that have received recognition 
at other major festivals. Moreover, we are pleased to 
inform everyone that we will be joined by legendary 
director Luke Norris. Mr. Norris, whose documentary 
White Lines will air this evening, has graciously offered to 
respond to questions during a meet and greet at  
8 p.m. And, as a final reminder, feel free to head to the 
lobby at any point to buy drinks and snacks.

As you may have heard, our art center is planning to 
display some works by Oscar Juan. I expect the show will 
attract many potential buyers as well as some media 
attention. This is because Mr. Juan will be featured in an 
issue of a national art magazine that comes out on 
September 27, which is roughly one week before the 
exhibit here will begin. Um . . . the exhibition will run from 
October 3 to October 14. As this will be our center’s most 
important exhibit yet, it is crucial that everything goes 
smoothly. Our curator will now show us some slides of 
the paintings we will be displaying and provide some 
background information on each. This will hopefully give 
us some ideas about how to organize the exhibit.

Welcome to this advanced sewing community education 
course. First, let me apologize for not showing up on 
time. I realized I left my class notes at my house while 
driving here, so I had to go home and get them.  
I promise that won’t happen again. Now, this course will 
be held over a three-week period. During that time, you 
will all have a chance to make either a dress or a suit 
jacket. It should be a lot of fun! Oh . . . And we previously 
kept fabric in the small closet near the door. However, 
that storage space was too small to hold everything.

Hello, Mr. Chen. This is Karen calling from the Emerald 
Lodge with regards to your interest in a recent inquiry. In 
your e-mail, you inquired about arranging transportation 
from the airport to our lodge. We have a shuttle bus that 
picks up passengers outside of the arrivals terminal. It 
stops directly across from the taxi stand. Moreover, you 
requested a room over looking the pool  area. 
Unfortunately, that entire wing will be unavailable to 
guests on the night you will be staying with us due to 
ongoing renovations. However, I can book you a larger 
room with a view of the ocean at no additional charge. 
Please contact me at 555-4024 to let me know whether 
that would be suitable.

Good morning, Ms. Harkins. I’m Owen Connor from the 
accounting department. I need to speak to you about the 
charges you made to your company credit card in London 
last month. I believe you were participating in the product 
launch at the Riverside Electronics Exhibition. I received 
your e-mail with the scans of the statements for your 
airfare, meals, and accommodations, but there’s an issue 
with one of the transactions. It is company policy that 
staff can only charge a maximum of £30 per meal. It 
would probably be best if we talked about this in person 
rather than over the phone. Why don’t you stop by my 
office tomorrow morning? Say around eleven? Thanks.

	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	

M:  Congratulations on completing your training period, 
Fiona. Everyone at the health center appreciates all 
the effort you’ve put in over the past month. How are 
things going from your perspective? 

W:  Thanks, Mr. Simmons. I’m quite happy, actually. The 
environment here is much more relaxed than the law 
office I worked at previously. 

M:  Great. That brings me to my other question . . . 
Would you be willing to do some overtime next 
month? Jack has booked some vacation time, so we 
need another receptionist to cover for him on 
Saturdays.

W:  Um, that might be OK. I’ll let you know for sure 
tomorrow.

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	

M:  Sally, are you busy at the moment? If not, I’d really 
appreciate a hand. I need to cut the boards that will 
be used to build the deck in the backyard.

W:  Do you have to do it right away? I’ve still got a few 
pieces of siding to attach to the house.

M:  No, I can wait. I’m going to get the power saw from 
my truck and move it to the backyard. Let me know 
when you are ready to begin.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation

W1:  Welcome to the Easton Electronics Service Center. 
M:   Hi. The lens on my digital camera is cracked, and I’d 

like to get it fixed. I bought it last June. 
W1:  OK. But as the one-year warranty has expired, you’ll 

have to pay for the full cost of the repairs. 
M:   Really? Yesterday, I stopped by the store I bought it 

from, and I was assured that it was still under 
warranty. 

W2:  Excuse me, but did you say you bought it last June?
M:   Yes.
W2:  Then it is still covered. We offered a two-year 

extended warranty for that model as a special offer 
last year.

W1:  Oh, I didn’t realize that. In that case, sir, I’ll just need 
you to complete this form.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	

W:  Don Stevens from the IT department just told me that 
a new operating system will be installed on all 
company computers next Thursday beginning at  
10 a.m.

M:  How long will the work take?
W:  About an hour . . . We’ll need to find something for 

our team members to do during that period.
M:  I’ll schedule a training workshop for that morning in 

the conference room. 
W:  Thanks. One more thing . . . Mr. Stevens asked that 

everyone disable their computer passwords so that 
his technicians can access the devices.

M:  OK. I’ll send an e-mail now to the people on our team 
telling them to do this.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	

M:  So, Ms. Greenly, where would you like me to take 
you next? 

W:  449 King Street. I have an 11 a.m. appointment 
scheduled with a few SoundDrive executives to talk 
about a series of television commercials they want to 
create.

M:  I’ll head there right away. And would you like me to 
wait in front of the building until you’re done?

W:  No. You can take your lunch break as I expect to be 
there for a few hours. I’ll call you as soon as I’m 
finished, and you can return for me then. 

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	

W:  Good morning. My name is Janice Walker, and  
I just ordered a sweater through your store’s Web 
site. But I noticed that my credit card was charged 
twice for that item. My order number is 44632.

M:  I’m really sorry about that, Ms. Walker. We have 
been having some issues with our online payment 
system today. I received several calls this morning. 

W:  I understand. Uh, when can I expect to receive the 
amount I overpaid?

M:  It will take a day or two to process the refund. Once it 
is completed, the system will send an automatic text 
message notification to you.

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Anita, a man told me he’s having trouble using one of 
the gas pumps. Could you provide him with some 
assistance? He’s wearing a brown coat. I need to 
stay at the cash register. 

W:  I was going to put some bags of chips on the shelves, 
but I can do that afterward. Did the man give you any 
more specific information about his issue?

M:  He’s having trouble paying with his credit card. My 
guess is that he’s putting it in backwards. Why don’t 
you try swiping it one more time? If that doesn’t work, 
then maybe the card’s magnetic strip is damaged.

M:  Mandy, do you have any plans for Saturday evening? 
The Milford Cinema is showing Paul Dorn’s latest 
movie. 

W:  That sounds wonderful. What time do you want to 
meet? I’m supposed to go to a museum with a friend 
from 3 to 5 p.m., but I’ll be free after that.

M:  I was thinking of going at 8 p.m. I’m having dinner with 
some colleagues that night, but we should be finished 
before then.

W:  OK. I’ll meet you at the theater at that time. And don’t 
worry about the tickets . . . I’ll order them online 
today. You paid when we went to the amusement 
park last month, so it’s my treat.

W:  Jordan, you know you’re responsible for making a 
chocolate cake, r ight? Some very important 
customers have made a reservation for tonight, and 
they’ve requested a fresh cake be prepared.

M:  Yes, I know. I measured the sugar, butter, salt, and 
cocoa powder a few minutes ago. However, the flour 
jar on the counter is empty, so I can’t finish preparing 
the ingredients.

W:  There’s a bag in the pantry. You’ll see it just to the 
right of the door. 

M:  Oh, OK. Since I’m new here, I wasn’t sure where to 
look. I’ll go get it now.

	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	

M:  Welcome to Central Hardware. Can I help you find 
anything?     

W:  Yes. I have a wood fence around my property, and  
I would like to coat it with something to protect it from 
the rain. Do you have any suggestions?

M:  Colman Wood Stain is a good brand. It’s easy to 
apply and not very expensive.

W:  Great. Um, I don’t know how much to buy, though.  
I wrote down the fence measurements in a notebook, 
but I forgot it at home. 

M:  We’re open until 7, so you have time to go home and 
get it. Once I know the size of the fence, I can tell you 
how much of the product you’ll need.

Questions	62-64	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
flowchart.	
	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Sorry I’m late. Todd Benson from Prime Appliances 
phoned to ask when he can expect to receive his 
next shipment of microwaves from us. Anyway, what 
do you want to talk about? 

M:  Our factory’s quality-control protocol. Numerous 
managers have complained that the process takes 
too long. This flowchart breaks down the various 
steps involved. 

W:  Hmm . . . How might we improve it?
M:  I think random product sampling is unnecessary. Any 

problems discovered during this stage would be 
found during performance testing anyway. 

W:  That’s true. Let’s get rid of that step, then. I’ll 
announce the change later this morning when I tell 
employees about the new warehouse that will be built 
next year.

Questions	65-67	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
seating	chart.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음	

M:  There’s been a last-minute change to our seating 
chart for tonight’s Writer’s House Award Ceremony. 

W:  How come?
M:  Apparently, Gregory Grimes, the director of the 

Writer’s House Foundation, recently sprained his 
ankle. He has asked to be seated at a table that is 
easy to access.

W:  OK. I will move him from the one directly in front of 
the stage to the one closest to the entrance.

M:  Yes, that’ll definitely be more convenient.
W:  Right. Now, I need you to wait near the entrance. 

When Mr. Grimes arrives, please tell him about the 
relocation once he has a chance to check his coat.

Questions	68-70	refer	to	the	following	conversation	and	
schedule.	
	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	

W:  Mr. Rolling just informed me that one of our training 
sessions tomorrow has to be moved to the afternoon 
so the new staff can take a tour of the factory. 

M:  I say we reschedule the session beginning at  
9 o’clock. The material is quite complicated, and we 
would have more time to cover it if we held the 
workshop later in the day.

W:  I was thinking we should postpone the one on 
warehouse regulations, but we can go with your 
suggestion. On a side note, did you make the 
instructional booklet for the quality-control session?

M:  Yeah. It’s in my office. 
W:  Excellent. Please go and get it now. I’ll wait for you in 

the conference room.

Hello, everyone. Now that we’ve departed from 
Vancouver, I’d like to quickly explain some things to you 
all. Our ferry ride to Sydney is going to last about an hour 
and a half. Passengers are asked to remain on the 
second level of the ferry, where there is plenty of seating. 
The tour bus will be parked on the lower parking level, 
but won’t be accessible during the ferry trip. Now, keep 
your eyes open for humpback whales while we travel. 
Over 100 live in the area, so you’re likely to see at least 
one.

Next on the agenda for this month’s meeting is the issue 
of package deliveries. As you all know, our apartment 
building will soon be changing its security policy, and 
delivery people will no longer be allowed to go past the 
lobby. Consequently, a new system is needed to make 
sure you all get your packages. Beginning next month, 
our daytime receptionist will accept parcels on everyone’s 
behalf and leave a slip in individuals’ mail slots notifying 
them about the delivery. Items can be retrieved at the 
front desk at residents’ convenience.

Hey, everyone. Can I have your attention for a moment? I

law firm to make some repairs. After Sandra Boyd 
cleared out her belongings in preparation for her move to 
our Dallas branch, some water damage was discovered 
in her old office. Anyway, the workers will locate the 
source of the leak, and replace a section of a wall. The 
work will likely be very noisy, so we have scheduled it for 
Saturday afternoon.

Before we return to work, I have a couple more points to 
mention quickly. First, do you all remember when  
I said I was thinking about having business cards printed 
for the entire staff at our advertising agency? I told you 
about the idea last month. Well, the company I looked 
into was disappointing. I received some sample cards, 
but the paper quality was very poor, so I’ll contact other 
companies. I also want to talk about the free cultural 
awareness training session that is being held two weeks 
from now. It’s open to professionals in any field, and it will 
take place at the Lowland Convention Center. It’d be 
good for each of you to participate.

Good morning, Ms. Prescott. It’s Adam Morris from 
Oakridge Pools calling. Sorry for not returning your call 
yesterday, but I was tied up preparing a site for a final 

inspection. Anyway, I want to let you know about a 
change related to your pool. Last Wednesday, I told you I 
need to put off the project because the tiles for the pool’s 
edge weren’t available until next month. Well, there was 
a miscommunication with my supplier. The shipment is 
scheduled to arrive tomorrow. If you’re okay with it, my 
crew members will head over to your property on 
Thursday morning. One of them will give you the initial 
invoice.

already sold out. During an interview on Weekly Sports 
Update last week, David Polanski, the coach of the

has a fast processor and an advanced camera. But 
customers have been really impressed by the new

life. Even our device’s main competitor only has an active 
battery life of about 15 hours, so we’re well ahead in that

	 캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Good morning. I don’t have a reservation, but I would 
like to rent a car for a couple of days. Do you have 
anything available?

W:  We do. What size car are you looking for?
M:  Something spacious enough for four people. Also, is 

it possible to get a vehicle with a large trunk? We 
have quite a bit of luggage.

W:  Of course. The CX2 sedan seats five people 
comfortably and has plenty of storage space. If you’re 
interested in that vehicle, we can begin filling out the 
necessary paperwork. I’ll just need to see your credit 
card and driver’s license in order to proceed.

W:  Spectrum Color Services. This is Danielle, what can I 
do for you today?

M:  Hello, I was wondering if you could tell me how much 
you charge to paint a living room.

W:  That would depend on the size of the room and the 
type of paint you choose. If you can give me that 
information, I could provide you with an estimate.

M:  Well, I just want basic white paint, but I’m not certain 
about the size of the room. I’ll go measure it right now 
and call you back in about 10 minutes.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Tricia, these necklaces are very impressive. Do you 
plan to sell them at your friend’s boutique like your 
other pieces?

W:  Yes. However, I feel as though my designs aren’t 
getting enough attention. So, I’m considering sending 
in an application to attend this year’s National 
Jewelry Expo to better advertise my work. 

M:  That’s a great idea. You could attract a lot of 
customers. 

W:  You think so? But, um . . .  the booth rental fee is 
$600. That seems quite expensive.

M:  Numerous people have used exposure from that 
event to help boost their businesses. I’m sure the 
same would happen for you. 

W:  You’re right . . . I’m gonna download the application 
form now and fill it out.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  I’d like to discuss a recent assignment that you 
collaborated with the marketing team on.

M:  No problem. Is there something specific you’d like to 
discuss?

W:  Yes, there is. You included an incorrect location in 
this online advertisement. It states that there will be a 
sale at our Seattle branch on July 22. However, the 
sale is actually going to be at our Portland branch. 

M:  Really? I’m so sorry about that! I must have missed 
that while proofreading the advertisement. I will make 
the necessary changes to the advertisement 
immediately.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation

W1:  Hey, Randy. Doesn’t your shift start at 9 o’clock? 
M:   Yeah, I came in early this morning to unpack the 

Digi 5 game consoles. They just arrived, and we 
need to get them on the shelves.

W1:  I see. Here . . . I’ll help.
W2:  Sorry to interrupt. I know we don’t open for five 

more minutes, but some customers have already 
started to form a line at the door. They’re here for 
the Digi 5.

W1:  I was going to keep stocking the shelves after we 
opened, but we’d better finish soon if people are 
lined up.

M:   Maybe one of us should ask Richard to give us a 
hand.

W2:  I can do that.
M:  Thanks. He should be in the storeroom. 

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Colson, the Winchester branch of our cinema will 
need more personnel for the summer. Maybe we 
should hire three additional employees for the 
evening and weekend shifts.

M:  Yeah . . . This is the busiest time of the year. Could 
you make a job posting? Just include a brief 
description of the position and list our required 
qualifications.

W:  Sure. I’ll try to finish it before I break for lunch.
M:  That’d be ideal. I’ll review it when you are finished, 

and then add it to our company Web site later this 
afternoon.

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Hello, I’m calling to reserve three tickets for the Wild 
Animals guided tour at Jungle Wonderland this 
coming Saturday. How much will that cost?

W:  It’s $40 per person. The tour begins at 9 a.m. and will 
last two and a half hours.

M:  Hmm . . . That’s higher than I had expected. Have 
your rates changed recently? My friend went on the 
same tour last month, and she said it cost $32 per 
person.

W:  She must have our Jungle Wonderland Annual Pass 
Card.  Cardholders automat ical ly  receive a  
20 percent discount on admission and tours in the 
wildlife preserve for a year.

W:  Was the unit in a building on Ferguson Avenue? If so, 

I received an e-mail from him about the vacancy last 
night. 

M:  Yes, that’s the one. The space has a very practical 
layout. Plus, there is enough room for a reception area 
and a private office. I was even introduced to the 
owner of the building, Janet Davidson. She was quite 
welcoming and professional.

W:  Yeah, but I discovered a crack in one of the masks.
M:  Really? That’s a problem since the other dive group 

has taken all the spare ones with them.
W:  Hmm . . . Splash World, the dive supply shop, is 

really close to here. If they have any in stock, I can 
go pick one up. Why don’t you give them a call and 
see if they have what we need?

M:   I think I’m ready for a new cell phone. Do either of 
you have any recommendations?

W1:  My phone has worked out great—the ShockPhone 20. 
It’s fast, and it has a modern design.

M:   I’ve heard that model’s great, but it’s out of my 
budget.

W2:  Mine’s a PlusTouch 50. It’s pretty basic, but it’s only 
$300.

M:   The less expensive one sounds better. I’ll purchase 
one at Harbor Cellular this weekend.

W1:  I heard that store is closed for renovations this 
month. 

W2:  Looks like you’ll have to go to Graystone Electronics 
instead. Fortunately, it’s having a sale.

M:   Thanks for the information. I wasn’t aware about 
Harbor’s closing.

M:  What for?
W:  I just realized that I left my camera in my car.  

I definitely want to have that on me today.
M:  OK, but I’d rather not walk all the way to our parking 

spot. It’s on the far end of the lot. 
W:  Well, we’ve already purchased our tickets, so why 

don’t I just meet you inside?

M:  Yeah, that’s fine. After you enter the park, go to 
Rollercoaster Mountain. It’s right next to Water 
World. And I’ll stop by the visitor center on my way to 
find out what time the parade begins today.

Pinkerton. However, the office listed for him on the

the second floor, but someone else was using that 
office. 

M:  Oh, I’m very sorry for the inconvenience. Mr. Pinkerton 
was recently transferred from marketing to sales, so 
he moved to another floor.

W:  I see . . . Well, where is his new office?

Caroline LeGrand, and I head the design department at

The lecture should last about two hours and take us right

I have a quick announcement. After receiving a few 
complaints, I had a technician look at our old shredder 
this morning. It appears that there is a serious problem 
with its cutting blades, and it has effectively stopped 
working. I know this is a major inconvenience for you all. 
However, I’ve contacted Mellor Supplies, and a delivery 
will be made this week. If you need to shred anything in 
the meantime, just use the one in the accounting 
department’s office on the third floor. Staff there have 
been notified that some of you may make use of the 
machine. All right, that’s all for now.

Hello. This is Tyrone Dyson calling from the city of 
Dallas’s Department of Parks and Recreation. I received 
your message yesterday about possibly reserving the 
main room at the Pointer Park Community Center for a 
gathering on Saturday, September 2. Unfortunately, 
another group has already booked the space for that 
specific date you requested. However, I’ve contacted 
Dallas’s other community center near Gleeson Park and 
was informed that they do have a space available at that 
time. If you are interested in booking that room, let me 

know. You can check out details and photos of the space 
by visiting www.dallasrecreation.gov. Thanks, and have a 
great day.

My name is Samir Nasser, and I’m a consultant and 
motivational speaker. I’ve been invited here by your 
employer to speak about how developing strong 
communication skills can improve your work life. As 
telemarketers for a software company, your ability to 
communicate with customers is obviously an essential part 
of your job. It enables you to express your thoughts clearly 
and concisely, which will in turn improve clients’ 
confidence in you. But communication skills are not only 
important when it comes to increasing sales. They’re also 
crucial for fostering healthy work relationships. In fact, 
the number one cause of workplace conflict is poor 
communication. To help prevent such issues, I’d like us all 
to participate in some activities together aimed at 
strengthening interactions between colleagues.

My name is Anita Busby, and you’re tuned in to Channel 
9 News. Today’s top story is on Williamton’s Citizen of the 
Year Award. This year’s recipient is Maude Evans, owner 
of Gately Automotive Dealership right here in Williamton. 
Ms. Evans has been selected for the award in recognition 
of her charitable work in the Williamton community. Over 
the previous six months, she has devoted much of her 
personal time to collecting donations for Memorial 
Hospital, a local health care facility. Moreover, Ms. Evans 
is also raising money in hopes of helping to establish the 
city’s first performing arts center. The award will be 
presented to Ms. Evans on September 22 at a dinner 
hosted by the Williamton City Council. The event will be 
attended by community leaders and city government 
officials.

Sally, it’s Richard Holsten. We need to find a location for 
our department’s Christmas party. This morning,  
I called Golden China—the restaurant we discussed 
yesterday—but the manager said that 30 seats are not 
available on that day. They could host us if we broke up 
into smaller groups . . . but that’s not really a good option. 
It’d be great if you could call the new place that opened 
on  Je f fe rson  S t ree t—Jacob ’s  S teak  House .  
I heard they have a private party room. I’d contact the 
place myself, but I’m headed to the airport now. With the 
event coming up in only three weeks, we need to make a 
reservation as soon as possible.

restaurant. For starters, we recently hired celebrity chef 
Dawn Rather to team up with our corporate chefs in order 
to improve our existing menu. As a result of the 
partnership, we’ve decided to offer preset food 
combinations to customers. Each one will feature a 
burger and a side dish. Of course, people can mix and 
match the burger styles and side options. For instance, 
they can change the barbecue burger and onion rings 
pairing to a barbecue burger and garden salad. Another 
important announcement is that we plan to redesign our 
logo. A replacement will be unveiled in July.

Welcome to Entertainment News. The organizer of the 
annual Calgary Music Festival has announced an 
interesting addition to the lineup of daily headliners. The 
press release from Lisa Gomez, who is in charge of 
booking acts, stated that international superstar  
DJ James Money will join his former partner Karl Slocum 
for the first time in over a decade at the festival. This is 
very exciting news for local music lovers. Viewers 
interested in attending should purchase tickets soon, as 
they are likely to sell out quickly. A pass for the entire 
festival costs $49, while tickets for individual concerts 
cost $30. And remember, half of the proceeds will be 
donated to a local orphanage, so you will be supporting a 
worthy cause while enjoying some great music.

appointment to have new carpet laid in your home. 
We’re going to be understaffed for the next couple of 
days and won’t be able to make it then. Thursday is 
the earliest we can come.

W:  That’s going to be inconvenient for me, as I’ll be busy 
on that day. Could you possibly do the work on 
Wednesday instead? 

M:  No, we’re fully booked on Wednesday as well. To 
make up for the inconvenience, though, I can take 15

the South American market. Would you be willing to 
do that?

W:  Normally, I would be. However, my team is working 
on another assignment, which is due in a few days. 
Unfortunately, I won’t have enough time to take on 
both tasks before the investors arrive.

M:  Oh, that’s right! I forgot you’re conducting research 
for a financial analysis. Well, the presentation is more 
pressing than the analysis, so please prioritize that. 
You should work on the other assignment later.

while I was in Boston. Here’s the receipt. 

M:  Hmm . . . Yes, this looks accurate.
W:  Then, why isn’t it in your records?
M:  Did you receive any error messages when you made 

the booking? 
W:  No . . . nothing like that. I’m a little worried, since the 

room has already been charged to my card.
M:  I’ll get my manager. This is an unusual case, so she’ll

W:  The report is nearly finished. I’m just waiting for some 

additional statistics from a colleague before  
I can finalize it. Everything will be completed by this 
afternoon. 

M:  Great. It would be best if you could bring a hard copy

M:  Yes, we are still trying to fill the position. We’re asking 
all applicants to provide us with a cover letter and a 
copy of their résumé before May 14, which is the 
deadline for submissions. So, could you send those 
documents to me at jose12@parkerdental.com?

W:  Oh, good. Yes, I’ll e-mail you those items later today. 
I’d appreciate it if you could notify me when you

W:  Hi. I recently bought a protective cover for my laptop 
computer on your Web site. However, I’d like to 
exchange it. The one I purchased is too small.

M:  So long as the item isn’t damaged, we’re happy to 
exchange it for you. However, you’ll be charged for 
the extra shipping and handling fees related to your 
request.

W:  That’s fine. I’m also hoping you can help me figure 
out which case will fit my computer. 

M:  If you provide the brand name and model of your 
laptop, I can look up the proper item code. You can 
then use the code to search for the product on our 
Web site.

M1:   We were already in the area helping a person 
whose truck wouldn’t start.  

M2:   Now, what seems to be the problem with your car?
W:    Well . . . I’ve got a flat tire, so I guess you’ll have to 

tow my car to a garage.
M2:   That won’t be necessary if you have a spare in the 

trunk.
W:   Um . . . Let me see. Yeah, everything’s good to go.
M1:   In that case, we can help you change the tire. It 

shouldn’t take us very long.

M:  This is Liam Gates calling from Ondine Bank. We are 
hosting our annual awards ceremony next month, 
and my associate strongly suggested using your 
company. I was wondering if we could meet this 
week to discuss the possibility of your business 
catering the event.

W:  I would be happy to do that, Mr. Gates. Most of my 
afternoons this week are free.

M:  What about tomorrow? Could you meet me here at 
our headquarters on Larson Avenue at two?

W:  That’s fine. But, before we meet, I suggest you take a 
look at our Web site. There are examples of menus 
we’ve prepared in the past as well as price lists. It 
should give you a better idea of what types of food 
we offer.

M:  I just had a meeting with our restaurant manager. He 
said that all the staff working in the dining area will 
have to wear uniforms starting next month. What do 
you think about that?

W:  Why not? Employees in other establishments wear 
them to look more presentable and organized. And 
think of the time it’ll save us every morning. We won’t 
have to figure out what to wear to work anymore.

M:  You’re probably right. It ’ l l  also be easier for 
customers to identify staff if we’re all wearing the 
same type of clothing.

W:  I just hope the uniforms aren’t uncomfortable to wear.

M:  I see. Will you be here before 10 a.m.? Our convention 
center is host ing the Bayport  Archi tectural 
Conference, so we have a lot of preparations to 

make.  
W:  No. I won’t arrive until noon.
M:  Well, at least you’ll be able to help prepare for the 

lecture being held at 1 p.m. The projector needs to be 
moved from Hall A to Hall C before the talk starts.

M:  OK. I can assist you with that. What seems to be the 
problem?

W:  Well, neither of the two largest poles came in the 
box. I have the other poles and pegs but am unable 
to assemble the tent. 

M:  I apologize for the inconvenience, ma’am. We’ll 
gladly provide you with the missing parts if you bring

W:  Let me see . . . Oh, that’s the one between the 
playground and the flower garden. Just follow the 
path through the flower garden to get to it. Um, 
wasn’t there a security guard at the entrance to give 
you directions?

M:  There was, but I didn’t think to ask. This complex is a 
lot bigger than I expected.

W:  Yeah, it is quite large. And it is going to get even 
bigger. A building with another 100 units will be going 
up in front of the parking lot next January.

Welcome to the annual Olympia Health Association

special guest with us tonight—Dr. Mildred Jenkins. Not 
only was Dr. Jenkins the first female heart surgeon to set 
up a practice in Olympia, but she was also our 
association’s first female president and the founder of our 
program to improve heart health among children in the 
city. However, I’m sure most of you already knew that. As 
for tonight, Dr. Jenkins will give us an update about her

so make sure to report any equipment problems to the

Good afternoon, everyone. I just met with the customer 
service manager to discuss the response to our newest 
e-book reader—the Universe Plus. The Universe Plus is 
our most advanced model ever, so it was expected to be 
well received. Yet, many customers complained about it. 
They say the screen is too dark and the operating system 
is overly complicated. Not much can be done about the 
screen until the next annual release, but I’m hoping our 
team can address the software problem. I’m going to 
e-mail all of you copies of the complaints now. I’d like you 
to look over them together and think of some ways to 
address the problem.

Thank you all for joining Synergy’s trial session. As you 
know, we produce bookkeeping programs for small 
companies such as yours. Well, in February, we’re 
replacing our best-selling program with a successor. 
Ledger Pro—the new application—builds upon the 
strengths of our top program and adds features that were 
requested in the customer experience surveys we 
conducted last quarter. For the test session, we’ll update 
your systems to Ledger Pro, and you will simply continue 
to perform your bookkeeping duties as you have in the 
past. If you come across any unfamiliar features, just let 
someone from our firm know, and we’ll walk you through 
them.

Good morning. This is Glenda Brown from LMZ Investments.  
I need to change an order that I recently placed on your 
Web site. Christina Chine, the manager of our new office 
in Miami, just notified me that she will have a larger staff 
than planned. We have some extra desks that can be 
used, and we won’t require additional cubicle partitions or 
file cabinets . . . but I need to double the number of seats. 
We’ll need, uh, 30 in total. The accounting manager 
wants me to use a different company credit card to pay 
for the new charges, so please call me back for the 
number and expiration date. My contact details are 
included on the original order form. Thank you.

W:  I know it’s not your fault, but the customers have 
been waiting for almost an hour . . . One of them just 
left.

M:  Sorry, but I don’t know what to tell you. I’m doing the 
best I can. 

W:  In that case, I think we’d better give them a discount

W1:  Wilma, I think our nonprofit organization needs a 
more effective fund-raising method.

W2:  Did you have something in mind?
W1:  What about an online campaign?
W2:  I’m not sure. Marcus, what do you think about 

changing to online fund-raising?
M:   We could do that. Web-based campaigns cost very 

little, so it could save money. I’m sure it would be 
better than hosting fund-raising dinners like we do 
now.

W2:  I see. Well . . . I’m open to the idea. However, I’m 
unfamiliar with the steps we’d need to take.

M:   I organized some campaigns at my previous job that 
were very successful. If you want, I can make an 
initial strategy proposal for you to review.

M:  I’m sorry to hear that. What do you have to do on 
Saturday?

W:  I just found out that some of my relatives will be in 
town then. I have to entertain them during their visit.

M:  Well, you’re welcome to bring them along. I’m sure 
they would enjoy the experience, as the festival has a

checkup.

M:  That’s not a good day for you to be gone, as we’re 
having a public relations workshop then. Everyone in 
our department is required to attend. You’d better 
possibly schedule your appointment for Friday or 
next Monday.

potential. We received hundreds of submissions, but 
have chosen your book for publication.

W:  Oh, that’s great to hear! I’m so honored!
M:  However, despite our interest, there are some

major—mostly stylistic issues.

W:  OK. Would you like to meet and further discuss

Welcome to the Masami Teahouse in Kyoto, Japan. The 
teahouse was built in the late 1700s and originally served 
as a private club for prestigious members of society. As 
you can see on this map, the complex includes a large 
dining area, kitchen, ceremonial rooms, garden, and even 
sleeping quarters for guests. Moreover, the teahouse was 
also used for numerous special occasions, including 
weddings, political gatherings, and receptions for 
members of the royal family. It now functions as a popular 
tourist site.

too close to their homes. Mary Stenos, the head of the 
transportation department, held a press conference on 
Wednesday regarding the matter. She stated that 
residents’ complaints were being taken seriously and that 
work on the SwiftRail would be stopped until the issue is 
resolved. She also said that updates will continue to be

W:  Good afternoon. I’m here to drop off the car I rented 
for the weekend. The vehicle is an SXA 390 sedan, 
and my name is Jenna Clarkson. 

M:  OK. I’d just like to ask you a couple of questions 
regarding the vehicle. First, was the car scratched or 
otherwise damaged while you were using it? Also, 
did you refill the gas tank prior to dropping it off, as is 
stipulated in the rental agreement?

W:  The car is undamaged, but I unfortunately wasn’t 
able to put gas in the tank before coming here. 

M:  Oh, then I’ll have to charge you an additional fee. 
Please wait a moment while I make the adjustment to 
your bill.   

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  It seems like the book fair went well overall. 
M:  For the most part. However, fewer people showed up 

than expected. That was a bit of a letdown. 
W:  Yeah, I was a little disappointed by that as well. 

Personally, I think we should have better advertised 
the event in order to attract more participants.

M:  I suggested running an online marketing campaign a 
few months ago. I’m not sure why our boss,  
M s .  G a b b e r t ,  n e v e r  f o l l o w e d  u p  o n  m y 
recommendation. 

W:  I think she couldn’t allocate any more money for the 
fair because our advertising budget had already been 
used for other projects.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Susan, I was very impressed with the article you 
handed in last Thursday about popular Kentsville 
dining spots. Also, a lot of people have posted on 
social media about one of the restaurants you 
mentioned. Uh, Lima Kitchen, the Peruvian 
restaurant that opened just recently . . .

W:  Thanks, Chris. It’s nice to hear that the public is 
pleased with what I wrote.

M:  Given the positive feedback, maybe you should do 
something similar. You could write a piece about 
another new dining establishment in the area.

W:  I’ve been asked to do just that, actually. I’m about to 
go to our head editor’s office to discuss that 
assignment right now.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation	with	
three	speakers.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M1:   There isn’t enough space in our garage to do all the 
repair work that we have been getting. Allen, do you 

think we need a larger facility?
M2:   Hmm . . . I’m not sure. Our customers might not 

know where our new location is. I’m worried our 
competitors might get some of our business if we 
move. 

W:   Actually, the vacant lot next door was just put up for 
sale. If we acquire it, we could have a bigger facility 
constructed on the land. That way, we would be 
able to expand right here.

M1:   That would be perfect! Let’s start by determining 
how much the parcel of land is being sold for.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  Stan, I just watched the promotional video you put 
together for our bakery.

M:  What do you think of it?
W:  It looks good, but I’m worried because the sale we’re 

having on cream-filled donuts isn’t mentioned in it.
M:  Unfortunately, the advertisement only runs for  

30 seconds, so I couldn’t include everything.
W:  In that case, could you take out the part at the end 

that shows the interior of our shop?
M:  Remove the final segment? You specifically asked 

for that content to be included. 
W:  I know. But providing information about the sale is 

more important at this point.
M:  OK. I understand now. I’ll make those changes this 

afternoon.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Hello. This is Danny Martinson calling from Westend 
Boutique. I’m sorry, but the evening gown you 
ordered online was returned to our shipping facility as 
the address you entered was inaccurate.

W:  I apologize for that. Could you please resend it?  
I live at 3258 Pleasant Avenue, Denver, Colorado.

M:  Certainly. It’ll take about five days to reach you.
W:  OK, that’s acceptable. While I have you on the 

phone, can you explain how to use discount coupons 
on your Web site? I’ve had trouble with them in the 
past.

M:  Before you complete your order, click the green 
“Promotions” button on the bottom of the page. Then, 
type the coupon code into the box that appears to 
apply the discount, and click “Submit.”

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	
	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  OK, Ms. Kelly, what seems to be the problem with 
your wrist?

W:  Well, it’s been bothering me a lot at my job lately.  
I bend my right wrist repetitively at work, so I think 
that might be the cause of the pain. I work in a shoe 
manufacturing facility, and I’m often pulling levers on 
massive equipment.

M:  I  see. In that case, I ’ l l  prescribe you some  
pain-killing medication. However, I recommend you 
speak with your boss about ways to ensure that the 
constant motions aren’t causing you any injuries in

M:  Candace, we’ve been advertising the programmer 
position for three weeks, but very few people have 
applied. Plus, none of the candidates have enough 
relevant work experience.

W:  Hmm . . . I’ll tell representatives from the recruitment 
Web site to run the advertisement for another week. 
Also, I think we should consider placing the job 
posting on some social media sites to attract 
applicants.

M:  I agree. Dylan Marks from the human resources 
department is familiar with those types of sites. After 
our 10 a.m. staff meeting, I’ll ask which ones he feels 
are most effective. 

W:  If he offers specific suggestions, can you let me know

W1:  Welcome to First United Bank. How can I help you?
M:   I’m here to apply for a loan to support my small 

business. I read about your financial services in the 
Folsom Herald.

W2:  Sorry, but I can assist you at this window regarding 
that matter, sir. My name is Jessica, and I work in 
the loan department. 

M:   Oh, sure. I own a self-service laundry facility, which 
needs multiple new washing and drying machines. 
The total amount of money I’ll need for them is 
$30,000. 

W2:  OK. However, the first step is completing a loan 
application. That will allow us to determine how 
much you qualify for. So, we should get started on 
that right away.

M:  You’re watching Priority Home Shopping. Today, I’ll 
be talking to Madeline Hartman about her firm’s best-
selling product.

W:  That’s right. Braxton Industries’ ES32 is the first 
suitcase with a magnetic luggage tag, a protective 
cover, and a removable travel pouch. 

M:  Amazing! This item certainly offers some great 
features.

W:  We’ve even added a built-in battery charger. With 
this suitcase, travelers can charge their phones on 
the go.

M:  Wow! Is it available now?
W:  Yes. And we are offering it to Priority Home Shopping 

viewers at 50 percent off its regular price. Interested 
shoppers should order soon, however, as this 
discount will be applicable for a limited time.

M:  When, exactly, will the sale end?

W:  Excuse me. I bought a ticket for one of today’s 
screenings at the film festival, but I seem to have lost 
it. 

M:  Well, if you paid by credit card, I can print you a 
replacement.

W:  I did . . . Um, here is my card.
M:  Great. Now, just to confirm . . . The film you want to 

watch is Low Horizon, right? 
W:  That’s correct. 
M:  OK, here is your ticket. Is there anything else I can 

help you with?
W:  Actually, there is. I parked my car on the street next 

to the theater. How long can I leave it there? 
M:  Oh, you should move it. Parking is not permitted 

there. I suggest using the garage across the street.

	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Hello, and welcome to Engel’s Department Store. Is 
there anything I can help you with?

W:  There is. I recently purchased some clothing here, 
and I noticed this pair of shoes was incorrectly 
scanned in as the more expensive deluxe version of 
the Wriggly line. 

M:  Let me confirm the error quickly . . . Yes, you’re right. 
I apologize for the mistake. I can give you a slip 
indicating store credit for the difference. 

W:  That’ll do. Oh . . . by the way, I wanna return this 
shirt, which I purchased at the same time. 

M:  Sorry, but sale items can’t be refunded.
W:  Actually, this one wasn’t discounted.

M:  Did you check the instructions at the top of the page?

I want. That fixes the issue. Thanks.   
M:  No problem. Is there anything else you need?
W:  Actually, I have a question . . . Can I take pictures

M:  Sure. But you aren’t allowed to film the performance.

I’m very excited to be here at the National Restaurant 
Association’s annual trade show at the Brighton 
Exhibition Hall, and I’d like to take this opportunity to tell 
you about Vend Corporation’s newest commercial 
dishwasher, the Clear Flow XS. Made almost entirely of 
stainless steel, the Clear Flow XS is durable and easy to 
clean. In addition, because of its innovative design, this 
appliance uses significantly less power than other 
models,  which saves money and benef i ts  the 
environment. And, of course, it is covered by Vend 
Corporation’s comprehensive, five-year warranty. Now, 
I’m sure many of you are wondering about cost, and I’ll 
go over that in detail soon. But first, I’d like to give a brief 
demonstration of this amazing product in action.

Business Institute. I just received a copy of the speech 
you plan to give for our lecture series on infrastructure 
investment and overseas development. Overall, I’m very 
pleased with it. However, I do have a recommendation. 
You might want to use visual materials to illustrate the 
data in your report—photographs or charts, for example. 
One other thing . . . I just found out that Carol Wilkins has 
to give her lecture on Friday given her travel plans. So, 
regarding your talk, June 15 works best for us. I’m hoping 
that will be fine since you said you’ll be in New York City

If you’re planning on building your own home, then now is 
the time to buy property! Silver Property Management is 
selling a large number of undeveloped, one-acre lots 
along Lake Brandon at reasonable prices. These lots 
have spectacular views and ample space for a range of 
landscaping possibilities. Another advantage is that while 
these properties have never had homes erected on them, 
they are ready to be connected to Hartford County’s 
water, electric, and sewer systems. There is a great deal 
of interest in these lots, and we expect them to sell out 
quickly. Don’t miss out on this great opportunity! If you

tasked with scheduling and setting up events at our 
facility. These activities are aimed at helping residents

participating in a customer service workshop next Friday. 
This will be a great opportunity for them to improve their 
skills and learn new techniques in assisting our service 
center clients. To avoid being understaffed then, 
management previously said personnel should not ask 
for the day off. Yet, several people recently made leave

members. I trust that they’ll understand our limitations.

received an e-mail from the CEO this morning stating that 
he would prefer to promote existing employees to fill 
these roles. He wants each hotel to implement a 
mentorship program for employees who demonstrate 
leadership skills. This will guarantee a large pool of 
suitable management candidates. To begin with, I would 
like each of you to provide a list of employees in your 
departments that have management potential. Um,

Hi, Sandra. I got your message about the team-building 
exercise you’re arranging for our department. I really like 
your idea of playing a soccer game at a park. Actually, 
there’s a great spot where we can play just a few miles 
from our workplace—Berkley Park. Maybe you’ve heard 
of it? It has a large field that can be reserved in advance. 
The only downside is that there’s very limited parking. 
People will have to use the nearby East Street Garage. 
We’ll probably only play for an hour, but I imagine we’ll 
want to hang out a bit afterward, so people will have to 
pay for two hours. Hopefully, that won’t be an issue.

	 캐나다식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Welcome to the Excel Corporate Charity Event. If you 
tell me your full name and the company you are 
affiliated with, I can let you know which seat you have 
been assigned to. 

W:  My name is Prema Khan, and I’m representing my 
investment firm, Mumbai International. But before  
I find my seat, is there a place where I can hang my 
coat? I’d rather not keep it with me all night.  

M:  First, let me lead you to your table. Then, I would be 
happy to check your coat for you. 

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.	

	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:   Hey, Mike and Floyd. Did you guys see the memo 
from human resources about the upcoming changes 
to the travel expense policy?

M1:   Yes. I’m glad the company has decided to increase 
the amount that employees can be reimbursed to 
$5,000 per trip.    

W:   Don’t you think it’s a bit high? On my last business 
trip, I didn’t spend more than $1,600 for all my travel 
expenses.

M1:   Sure . . . but you and the other sales staff don’t have 
to travel internationally.

M2:   Exactly. Members of the technology team, like Floyd 
and I, go abroad frequently to complete projects.

W:   Oh, right. I forgot that your department is putting in 
the computer system for one of our international 
partners’ new headquarters.

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음

M:  Ms. Ellison, is it possible for us to get new computer 
monitors for the office? The graphic designers say 
the resolution quality of our current computer screens 
is rather poor. It seems to negatively impact their 
work. 

W:  I’ve been meaning to do that for quite a while. We 
couldn’t afford to upgrade in the past, but we have 
enough funds this month. I’ll ask the office manager to 
order high-resolution monitors for all our designers. 

M:  They will certainly appreciate that. And if you’re 
unsure about which models to get, I can ask the staff 
for their opinions on the matter.

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 미국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Hi, Adrian. I need to talk to you about our plans for 
tomorrow. I know I offered to drive us to the 
amusement park in the morning, but I don’t think I’ll 
be able to. For some reason, my car won’t start. I’m 
going to have it towed to a repair center to be fixed. 

M:  That’s OK. Rachel should still have room in her van, 

so I’m sure we can ride with her instead. 
W:  Great. Do you think she will also be able to pick me 

up from my house? Since I won’t have a vehicle, it 
will be hard for me to meet up with everyone. 

M:  I don’t think she’ll mind, but I’ll ask her anyway. 

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	

	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Beth . . . I’m glad I caught you. Our company is 
designing Fieldstone Financial’s new Portland  
office building. I’m meeting with one of their 
representatives next week to talk about the project 
timetable, and I’d like you to join me.

W:  OK. I heard about the new contract, but I didn’t know 
I’d be involved. I assume you’re going to be running 
the project, right?

M:  Jenna Adams will be the team leader. I’ll only be 
involved in the early stages.

W:  This is going to be her first time in a management 
role, isn’t it?

M:  Yes. But she has worked on similar projects in the 
past, so I’m confident that she will do well.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Hey, Larry. How are things going here at the ticketing 
office? I just want to check and see if the new 
software we installed is working OK.

M:  Oh, it’s been wonderful! It is easy to use and saves a 
lot of time. I’ve been able to serve twice as many 
customers as usual this morning.

W:  That’s good news. I was hoping it would make your 
job easier. Do you think any other agents will need 
training on how to use it?

M:  Yes. Two new employees are starting next week, so 
I’ll have to provide them with some instructions.

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 호주식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Welcome to Prim Hair. Do you have an appointment 
with one of our stylists today? 

W:  Oh, I’ve stopped in to view your selection of 
merchandise. I use Nature’s Touch shampoo and 
was told that you carry the brand. If so, I’d like to buy 
some. 

M:  Yes, we do. Also, we’re having a promotion on that 
brand this week, so everything from that line is 
available for 10 percent off its normal retail price. 

W:  That’s great. I’ll look over what you have in stock. 

Questions	53-55	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음	

W:  I just went through the financial report prepared by 
the accounting team. I’m a little concerned because 
sales have declined at many of the cosmetics stores 
we operate.

M:  I know. Apparently, our main competitor now offers 
an online service. Customers can order products 
through the company’s Web site and have them

customers have to visit our shops in person. 

W:  That’s not good. We need to figure out a way to be

M:  Hi, Brenda. Do you have any plans for this Saturday? 
I was hoping to go to the opening of a photo exhibit at 
Mendez Gallery with some other members from our 
department. Would you like to come with us?

W:  Thanks for the invitation. I was supposed to meet my 
friend Peter, but he called and said he couldn’t make 
it due to a family obligation. So, I’d be happy to come 
with you to the exhibit instead.

M:  Wonderful! I’m sure you’ll like the nature and 
landscape pictures at the gallery. By the way, we’re 
thinking of having lunch at a café in the area before 
going to the gallery. You are more than welcome to 
join us.

M:  Hello, this is Joshua Curtis from Ridley Institute. We 
were supposed to receive a piece of specialty 
laboratory equipment from your store last Friday, but 
it wasn’t delivered.

W:  Oh, I apologize for that. Your item was most likely 
included in the recent shipment, which was delayed 
due to bad weather. Now that weather conditions 
have improved, your order will be mailed out today.

M:  I hope I get the machine soon because we’ll need it 
for our next research project. Do you know when the 
shipment will arrive here?

W:  I just heard that the CEO of Lorcam Industries will 
visit our office this afternoon. Apparently, she is 
considering placing a large order with us.

M:  I know. Our director wants me to organize a dinner 
so that our management team can meet her.

W:  Have you found a suitable place yet?
M:  Yes. The Belleview Bistro on the corner of Johnson 

Street and Elm Avenue . . . I’m going to stop by there 
this afternoon to pay the deposit for a private room.

W:  Sounds good. Oh, by the way . . . I made the changes 
you requested to the employee manual yesterday.

M:  Sorry, ma’am. I know you’ve been sitting here for a 
few minutes, but I had to finish up at another table 
before serving you. Have you had a chance to review 
the menu?

W:  No need to apologize. As for food, I think I know what 
I want—the olive and artichoke pasta, please. 

M:  An excellent choice. And for your side dish? The 
lemon kale salad is particularly wonderful.

W:  That sounds a bit light to me. I think I’ll go with the 
third choice. Also . . . do you have chamomile tea? I’d 
really enjoy some. 

M:  Let me ask our kitchen staff when I put in your order. 
I’ll let you know shortly.

M:  That’s right. We’ve got a lot of things to prepare. But 
I’m looking forward to going to Baltimore. I’ve always 
wanted to visit there. Plus, I was informed that all of 
our costs will be covered.

W:  Oh, that reminds me . . . Ms. Owens asked me to

Hello, this is Jamie Foster at Phoenix Merchandising. 
This message is for Ms. Helen Rohan. I need to inform 
you that the specific model of VelociClean vacuum 
cleaner that you ordered is out of stock. However, we do 
have something similar called the Weyden Platinum. It is 
lightweight and removes more dirt from carpets than other 
models. Because of its design, it’s easy to control and 
move around any indoor space. And since we were 
unable to fulfill your original request, we can offer you 
free delivery if you purchase the Weyden product. If 
you’re interested, you should visit our shop, and I’ll show 
the vacuum to you.

The Culinary House. Today, you will be learning how to 
make homemade pizza. This will be the first of three 
dishes that you’re going to make. I’ve already set printed 
booklets on the counters containing all of the recipes that 
you’ll need this morning. Please take them out and open 
up to the recipe on the second page. Before you start 
cooking this meal, however, you all need to break up into 
pairs. Since there aren’t enough utensils for each student, 
everyone will have to find someone else to work with.

Hello, Zack. My name is Allison Peng, and I’m calling 
from Creative Prime Agency. I’ve contacted several 
galleries in the Richmond area about your work and 
heard back from Electric Space downtown. The curator 
from that gallery expressed great interest in the 

contemporary paintings you created and said she’d be 
delighted to exhibit them there in October. I know you 
use oversized canvasses for your work, and Electric 
Space has tall ceilings and a large back entrance. So, 
please let me know your thoughts on the opportunity as 
soon as you can.

May I have your attention, please? An inspector from the 
Federal Department of Safety will be visiting our plant 
next Friday, the 12th. I just want to remind you all of a 
few things. First, because the inspector will examine 
each work area, you all must ensure that our safety 
equipment is in good condition. Following this meeting, I 
will hand out lists of things to check. Please fill these out 
and hand them in to your supervisor by the end of the 
day .  A lso ,  there  w i l l  be  a  shor t  meet ing  a t  
3 o’clock for all departmental managers. Since the 
conference room has been reserved already, we’ll gather 
in my office. At that time, we will go over the entire 
schedule of events for the day the inspector visits our 
facility. OK, that’s all for now.

Today marks an important development for both 
Hanaway Industries and Glarris Technologies. Now that 
our two companies have combined to form Hanaway and 
Glarris Incorporated, we are the largest information 
technology firm in Europe. By consolidating our resources, 
we have positioned ourselves to serve clients more 
successfully than ever. This will surely be a benefit to our 
customers and the industry as a whole. However, we 
have a lot of work to do before we become fully 
operational. To that effect, employees from both of the 
formerly separate companies must continue to establish 
effective communication with each other in order to 
improve efficiency. That will be our primary focus over 
the next two months.

Hello, Mr. Meade. This is Matthew from Bellville Interiors. I 
want to let you know that we’ll be able to put up the 
wallpaper in your new office next week on March 29 
rather than April 3, as one of our current projects will end 
earlier than expected. You wanted us to start as soon as 
possible, so I assume this plan is acceptable, but . . . um, 
please call me back to let me know for sure. One more 
thing. I double-checked the measurements of your office, 
and it will actually take 11 rolls of wallpaper to cover the 
walls. I’ll update the original invoice and send you a new 
copy this afternoon. The only change will be the 
additional charge of $38 . . . plus tax, of course.

After reviewing last quarter’s financial reports, the CEO 
has decided that we need to reduce expenditures across 
the board. He asked that all employees come up with 
ways to cut their department’s expenses. So, it’s our 
responsibility to reduce spending in the marketing 
department. This is a priority, so you should postpone 
your other projects if necessary. There isn’t much we can 
do about the expense that accounts for the greatest 
share of our operating budget, but I guess we could try to 
reduce the next largest item by 20 percent. I have 
prepared an overview of our department’s monthly 
expenditures to help you with this task. Um, I’ll hand it out 
to everyone in a minute.

M:  This is Dennis Walden, head of The Music Collective. 
I recently hired your agency to organize and promote 
a charity concert for my foundation. I’m calling to see 
how the preparations are coming along. 

W:  For the most part, things are going well, Mr. Walden. 
However, the band that you want to book will be 
performing elsewhere on the night of the event. So, I’m 
afraid they can’t participate. 

M:  Hmm . . . In that case, why don’t you see if the Sifters 
are available? They played at one of our fund-raising 
banquets last year, and everyone seemed to enjoy 
their music. You should get in touch with them. 

Questions	35-37	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	

	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  This launch for our firm’s GPS navigation device is 
going very well. It might be the most successful event 
that I’ve overseen since I started working as the 
manager of the product development team.

W:  Yes, a lot of technology bloggers and industry figures 
have shown up. They all seem very impressed with 
the device. Hopefully, they’ll bring positive attention 
to it as well as our firm.

M:  I think they will. In fact, I just spoke with Emily Scott, 
a staff writer from Everyday Science. She intends to 
publish a favorable review about our product on her 
company’s Web site. 

Questions	38-40	refer	to	the	following	conversation	
with	three	speakers.

	 호주식	발음	→	영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

M1:   I’m glad you’re both here. I was just going through 
the sample we received from the printer.

W:   Do you mean the Psychology 101 textbook that we 
will publish on March 31?

M1:   Right. But we have a problem. The graph on page 
234 was printed upside down. We will have to 
postpone publication because there are 5,000 
copies that will need to be reprinted.

M2:   You know, there was a similar situation last year, 
and the printer just replaced the page that contained 
the error. The entire process took only a few days.

M1:   That’s a relief. I’ll call the printer now and explain the 
situation.

W:   Actually, I have to discuss some shipping charges 
with the manager of the print shop. I’ll go there now 
and deal with this as well. 

Questions	41-43	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  Good morning. I’m planning to take golf lessons, and 
I’d like to rent a set of clubs from your shop. I’ll need 
them for three months, starting from today.

M:  Not a problem. Our rental  pr ices are quite 

competitive, and the fee includes damage insurance 
for the clubs. However, we recently modified our 
rental rules, so you’ll have to rent them for at least six 
months, which is a bit too long for you, I think.

W:  Hmm . . . I can practice with them after I complete the 
lessons. 

M:  All right. A piece of photo ID is required to rent our 
equipment, so I’ll need to look at that first.

Questions	44-46	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 영국식	발음	→	캐나다식	발음

W:  Sorry I’m a few minutes late, but it took me almost 
two hours to drive to the office today. Traffic on the 
freeway was extremely slow.

M:  Really? I can’t believe it took you so long. Why don’t 
you just use public transportation? I’m sure it would 
be a lot faster than driving.

W:  Well, the nearest subway or bus station from my 
apartment is 20 minutes on foot. With the cold weather 
here, I prefer not to walk. So, I usually end up taking 
my car.

M:  Actually, the Transport Authority just changed its city 
bus routes. I think bus 402 now stops in your 
neighborhood, so that would be really convenient for 
you. I’ll forward you a link to the city Web site for you 
to review.

Questions	47-49	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 캐나다식	발음	→	미국식	발음

M:  Rochester Convention Center. How can I help you?
W:  Good morning. I’m calling about the Westgate Auto 

Show on May 18. I know that tickets are $20 per 
person, but I will be attending with the other members 
of my auto club. Is it possible for us to get a group 
rate?

M:  Yes. But you’ll need to discuss it with Carol 
Humphrey who is in charge of group ticket sales. Her 
e-mail address is carol@conventionpro.com.

W:  Great. We’re really excited about the upcoming 
exhibit of antique cars.

M:  We have some promotional material from the 
company that is organizing that event. Why don’t I 
send it to you?

W:  I picked up a brochure yesterday. But thanks.

Questions	50-52	refer	to	the	following	conversation.	

	 영국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  I heard that you just returned from your business trip 
to Cape Town. How did it go?

M:  Everything related to work went well, but the rest of 
my time there was a bit disappointing. It rained 
throughout my stay, so I didn’t get a chance to walk 
around the city.

W:  That’s a shame. Cape Town has various public parks 
and some really beautiful monuments. I suppose you 
weren’t able to see any of them.

M:  No, I had to spend most of my free time in my hotel 
room. On the day before my departure, I watched a 
traditional dance at a nearby cultural center, though. 
It was very interesting.

W:  A few of the convention attendees are curious 
whether video or audio clips of today’s talks will be 
posted online. Do you know if that is going to 
happen?

M:  Only some of them will be shared following the event. 
Is there a particular lecture that people are inquiring 
about?

W:  Yes, a number of attendees have asked about Lillian 
Kraft’s talk on investing in foreign markets. Many of 
them seem to have been quite impressed.

M:  She is the keynote speaker, so video clips including 
her talk will definitely be uploaded to the Web site. 
You can inform anyone who inquires about it that 
they will be able to access them later on.

M:  Felicity Gifford, who is one of the students coming to 
the library for today’s job-search workshop, uses a 
wheelchair. We need to make sure she’s able to 
comfortably pull her wheelchair up to a table.

W:  Nick and I can take care of that since we’re planning 
to shift some of the furniture around anyway. More 
people than anticipated registered for the class, so 
the tables and chairs must be rearranged to make 
better use of the space.

M:  All right. Also, if a lot of people are coming, we should 
have one of our staff members welcome participants 
at the front door and help them find their seats.

Questions	59-61	refer	to	the	following	conversation.

	 미국식	발음	→	호주식	발음

W:  I’m looking for someone to help me create a poster to 
increase awareness of our community association. 
Another member told me that you are a graphic 
designer. But I thought that you work at a law firm.

M:  Yes, I’m a legal assistant at Beale and Associates 
here in town. However, I do freelance graphic design 
to make extra money on the side. 

W:  Great. Well, we want to place the poster in cafes and 
other businesses in the neighborhood. Hopefully, it 
will draw in more people to our weekly meetings. 
Would you be willing to make it?

M:  Of course! I’d be happy to volunteer my time to the 
association. I’ll begin working on it this evening.

M:  Thank you for calling EZ Home Cleaning. What can I 
assist you with today?

W:  My uncle referred me to your company, and I’m 
interested in your services. I need my floors 
vacuumed, my furniture dusted, and my bathrooms 
cleaned. 

M:  We can do that for $70. If you’d like your windows 
cleaned as well, we have another package that costs 

$80.
W:  That won’t be necessary. Would you be able to send 

someone to my house this Saturday or Sunday?
M:  Actually, we are fully booked for the weekend, but we 

can do it on Monday at 10:00 a.m. or Tuesday at 7:00 
p.m.

W:  Monday would work best for me.

M:  Hello, this is Jack Parker. I made a reservation for 
Friday at 12:30 p.m., but I’d like to move it to . . . um  
. . . to 6:00 p.m. Some important clients will be at our 
office for a presentation that afternoon, and I will 
need to participate.

W:  No problem, Mr. Parker. And just to let you know, we 
recently updated our menu, and there are several 
new entrées available.

M:  I saw that on your Web site when I downloaded a 
coupon this morning.

W:  The one for a free entrée? Actually, you won’t be 
able to use that with your reservation for Friday 
evening. I’m sorry.

M:  Oh, I see the problem. I’ll use it some other time, 
then.

M:  Juliana, two new animals are being transferred to our 
zoo tomorrow.

W:  The pandas—I heard. When will they get here?
M:  About an hour before the zoo opens. Anyway, could 

you put some bamboo shoots in these buckets? That 
way, they’ll have food when they arrive.

W:  No problem.
M:  And after that, please check whether the panda 

enclosure is clean. If not, we should wash it out this 
afternoon.

W:  Do you mean the enclosure near the back exit on 
Lee Drive or the one near the sea life exhibit?

M:  I’m talking about the one on Parker Lane.

American authors. These publications are on loan from 
the University of Minneapolis and will be displayed in the 
lobby for the duration of the fair. And I would like to thank 
this year’s corporate sponsor, Camdale Enterprises, for

Before we explore the Chakra Wildlife Park, I want you to 
listen closely to the following instructions and information. 
First, food is not permitted inside the park. Second, 
photographs are allowed, but please do not use a flash 
because the light scares the animals. Third, do not exit 
the shuttle at any time during the tour. As a reminder, 
there will be an hour lunch break at the Jungle Café after 
we’re done touring the African wildlife compound. Once 
everyone has finished eating, we will resume the tour by

please follow me, we will begin our tour.

Now for our morning business update on WKSR Talk 
Radio. Oregon-based car manufacturer Aster attracted 
attention over the weekend when a letter it sent to 
shareholders was leaked to the press. The letter primarily 
addressed the company’s ongoing financial struggles. 
But that’s not all. In addition to detailing persistent 
quarterly losses, Aster CEO Giselle Bram outlined the 
company’s plan for the future. To the surprise of many, 
the most poorly reviewed hatchback model is expected to 
be dropped from production this summer. Although Aster 
has yet to publicly respond to inquiries regarding the 
matter, experts who are familiar with the company believe 
the reports are likely to be true.
