Subject: New menus? 
Date: March 4 
Dear Natalie, 
I was doing some browsing earlier ---120.--- I noticed 
an advertisement for a local company called Print-U-
Rite. They’re offering online discounts on all kinds of 
specialty jobs. It’s been awhile since we printed new 
menus. The current ones look rather ---121.---. What 
do you think about printing a new set? ---122.---. 
We’d need to have new photos of some dishes, but 
with the money we’d save on printing, the overall cost 
would be manageable. I know a photographer who 
took pictures at a friend’s bakery. The results were 
quite good. I don’t think he charges ---123.--- high 
fees. Anyway, let me know soon! The offer ends on 
March 31. 
Best regards, 
Teresa
