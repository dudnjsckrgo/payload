(D) over 
Inquiries may be directed through the Web page. 
Questions 150-152 refer to the following article. 
Most Popular Unknown Tourist Spots 
It may sound contradictory, but these days, the most popular 
tourist spots tend to be those that no one knows about. This is 
occurring because people no longer seek traditional yet ------- 
locations on their vacations. 
150. (A) inundated 
(B) established 
(C) widespread 
(D) fashionable 
Instead, they are eager to find quieter, unpopular and less 
overcrowded places. 
These less-visited destinations can be islands, such as Saba 
in the Caribbean. Some are unique regions of well-known 
sites, like the Havasu Falls of Arizona’s Grand Canyon. And 
then there are the places most people probably did not know 
existed, like Cape Coast in Ghana. What they all have in 
common is that they are largely untouched ------- the shops 
and tour buses characteristic of overly popular spots. 
151. (A) in 
(B) by

(D) through 
Finding these places is often as simple as ------- searches 
online and a chat with a knowledgeable travel agent.

(B) quickly 
(C) quickest 
(D) quickens 
However, those who want to experience a lovely, untroubled 
vacation had better hurry. Given the number of Web sites and 
blogs discussing these places, they will not be unknown for 
long.
