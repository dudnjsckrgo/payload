Subject: Miller School courses 
Date: October 30 
Dear Mr. Hasford, 
I am writing to express my interest in the professional 
development courses you offer at the Miller School’s 
downtown Charleston location. I have been working as a 
graphic designer for over 10 years, but I still feel the need to 
improve my computer skills. It seems that the Miller School is 
working to provide courses on up-to-date design tools ------- 
contrast to the outdated techniques I learned in  
150. (A) beneath     (B) in  
(C) away        (D) beside 
design school. 
In particular, I am curious about signing up for the class 
entitled Using ClearSit, as I’ve heard many of my coworkers 
know quite a bit about that application. However, I’m not 
exactly sure how to sign up for the class. Unfortunately, no ---
----- information was noted in the advertisement I found.  
151. (A) contact        (B) registration  
(C) cancellation    (D) subscription 
Could you please let me know how to go about doing that? 
Also, if possible, can you recommend other courses your 
school teaches on new design tools other than ClearSit? I am 
always interested in improving myself ---------  
152. (A) financially     (B) physically 
(C) structurally    (D) technically 
to increase my performance at work. 
Thank you for your assistance in advance.
