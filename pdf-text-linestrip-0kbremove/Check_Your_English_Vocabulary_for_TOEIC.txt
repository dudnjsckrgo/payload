Introduction
This book has been written for anyone who is planning to take the TOEIC®, and who wants
to practice and develop their vocabulary. A greater command of vocabulary is one of the key
factors that will help you raise your TOEIC® score.
You should not go through the exercises in this book mechanically. It is better to choose
areas that you are unfamiliar with, or areas that are of specific interest or importance to you.
Each exercise is accompanied by a full answer key at the back of the book. This key also
gives you other information about particular vocabulary items (for example, words with
similar meanings, alternative words and expressions, etc.) that are not covered in the
exercises themselves.
When you are doing the tasks in this book, look at the instructions carefully to make sure
you understand what to do, then read through the text / questions first before attempting
the exercises. This is a useful 'skimming' technique that you should also use when you are
doing the TOEIC® itself.
We recommend that you have a good dictionary with you, and refer to it when necessary.
However, always try to do the exercises without a dictionary first, and then use a dictionary
to check anything that you are not sure of.
It is very important to keep a record of new words and expressions that you learn, and
review these on a regular basis so that they become a part of your 'active' vocabulary. Unless
you are taking the TOEIC® Test of Spoken English, the TOEIC® is an exam which tests your
language recognition skills rather than your language production skills. However, if you
familiarize yourself with the vocabulary in the book by reviewing it and then trying to use it
in your written and spoken English on a regular basis, you will be in a better position to
recognize it if and when it comes up in the exam.
No vocabulary book can possibly contain all of the words and expressions that you are likely
to come across in the TOEIC®, so it is important that you acquire new vocabulary from other
sources. Try to read as much as possible from a different variety of authentic reading
materials (books, newspapers, journals, magazines, etc.), and familiarize yourself with
spoken English by listening to English-language radio stations and watching English-
language movies and television programs whenever possible.
Try to get plenty of exam practice before you do the exam itself, so that you become familiar
with the format. There are several books, courses and other publications that will help you.
Barron's How to prepare for the TOEIC® (ISBN 0 7641 7514 9), which contains lots of helpful
advice as well as complete model tests, is particularly useful. 
We hope you enjoy doing the exercises in this book and that they help you to practice and
develop the vocabulary that you need. Good luck in the TOEIC®!

Computers and information technology

For reference see Easier English Intermediate Dictionary (0-7475-6989-4).
CD drive     components     CPU (Central Processing Unit)     desktop     DTP (desktop publishing)
flash-drive     hard disk     hard drive     keyboard     laptop     load     memory     monitor

This is my new (1) computer that sits on top of a table or desk (I've also got a (2) small computer which
can be carried or placed on your knees). As you can see, there are six main (3) parts to it. The first is the
(4) part of the computer that runs it and controls what it does, and this is the most important bit. It
carries the (5) part that stores and controls the flow of information, including the (6) round thing that
is used for storing information. Mine has a particularly high (7) capacity for storing information, which
means that it's much faster than most. It came with its own (8) computer programs package (including (9)
writing, checking and changing texts, (10) calculating in columns of figures, and (11) producing
texts and pictures for magazines packages). You can also (12) put in other programs using the (13)
sliding tray for carrying round, plastic, information-holding things, or the (14) hole for connecting
computer parts to one another (into which you can put a (15) small plastic and metal stick which can
hold a lot of information). The other five parts of the computer are the (16) screen that lets you see
what your computer is doing, the (17) flat thing with the letters and numbers on it that let you
control the computer, the (18) machine that lets you make copies of the documents that you create
on your computer, the (19) device for making color copies of photographs and other documents
which you can put onto your computer, and last but not least, the (20) device that you hold in your
hand and move across your desk to control the cursor.
access     attachment     bookmark     browser     chatrooms     crashing     delete
download     email     homepage     Internet     keywords     links     log on     log out
online     pop-up     provider     search engine     spam     upgrade     virus     website
Now, in my opinion, the best thing about modern information technology is the (1) network that links
millions of computers from around the world. Once you've got yourself a / an (2) company that allows
you (3) entry, and a (4) program that finds information you can start using this. It's especially useful if
you want to get information about something, go shopping or (5) transfer information, games, music, etc.,
onto your own computer. You can even 'talk' to other computer users in (6) special places where you can
leave messages and get instant replies. Most companies have their own (7) special computer pages
which you can look at. Let me (8) turn the computer on, enter my code and access the computer
system, and I'll show you ours. OK, here we go. Oh no, another (9) advertisement that suddenly appears
on the computer screen. How annoying. Let me just remove it. That's better.
Now, I can never remember the exact address of our company, so first of all I'll type it into the (10) program
that helps you find the information you want.  OK, A & C Black Publishing. The computer identifies the
(11) most important or main words and then gives me (12) connections to a list of possible sites. This one
looks right: www.acblack.com. I'll click on that. Bingo! Here's our (13) front page. You can use this to find
the different books that we publish, and if you want you can even buy them (14) through the computer.
Hmm, this book looks good: Check Your English Vocabulary for TOEIC®. Now, before I (15) exit this site, I'll
just (16) add it to my list of favorites so that I can find it more quickly next time.
Perhaps the most important thing, however, is (17) a special electronic letter-sending facility, which
allows you to communicate with people around the world in an instant. Let me quickly check mine. Oh dear,
nothing very interesting. Mainly a load of (18) unwanted advertising. I'll just (19) remove it: I don't
particularly want to rent a vacation home in Mexico, have my future read by one of America's top astrologers
or buy a phone that lets you smell the person you're talking to. There's something here from my sister with
a / an (20) document or file that has been sent with it. You have to be careful with these: sometimes they
contain a (21) hidden routine placed in the program that destroys or corrupts files. If you open it, it
can do all sorts of horrible things to your computer. I had one last week that kept (22) shutting down my
computer. I do have a protection package, but it's a bit out of date: I really ought to (23) bring it up to date.

Job recruitment
25
For reference see Easier English Intermediate Dictionary (0-7475-6989-4).
Part 1
When a company has a (1) vacancy / vacant for a job, and it needs to (2) hire / recruit a new member of
(3) crew / staff, it usually (4) publicizes / advertises the (5) post / position. It does this (6) internally /
internationally (for example, in the company magazine or on a company notice board, so that the job is
only open to people already working for the company), or (7) extensively / externally in the 'situations
vacant' section of a newspaper. It might also use a recruitment (8) agency / agenda, which helps people to
find (9) job / work.
A job advertisement has to give an accurate (10) describing / description of the job and what the company
needs and expects from the (11) applicant / application (the person who is (12) applying / appalling for
the job). These (13) requirements / requisitions might include (14) qualifications / qualities (academic,
vocational   or   professional),   (15)   experience /   experiences in   similar   lines   of   work,   and  personal
(16) qualifications /  qualities (for  example,  it  might  say  that  you  need  to  be  (17) practicing /
practical, (18) professional / professorial and have a sense of humor). 
Most advertisements specify the (19) rewards / remuneration that the company can offer in return for your
work  (including  the  basic  annual  (20)  wage /  salary,  any  commission  you  could  receive,  regular  pay
(21) rises / increments, and so on). Some advertisements will also tell you about other (22) benefits /
beneficial (including paid annual (23) leave / vacations, free medical care, a company car, free meals in the
cafeteria, etc.) that you might receive. If the (24) packet / package they are offering is very generous and
attractive, and is (25) commensurate / commendable with the work that is necessary, the company can
expect a lot of people to apply for the job. 
Part 2
If somebody is interested in the job, they are usually asked to send to send their (1) resume / résumé with a
(2) cover / covering letter. Alternatively, they might be asked to (3) fill in / fill out an (4) application /
applicant form and (5) submit / send it to the company. The managers of the company will read these and
then make a (6) short-list / small-list of the people it wants to (7) attend / attempt an interview. At the
same time, it will (8) reject / turn down those who it feels are (9) unsuitable / unthinkable.
During and after the interviews, the managers will consider the different aspects of the (10) candidates /
applicants to decide whether they have the correct (11) potency / potential for the job. These might
include   physical   (12)   apparition /  appearance (are   they   smart   and   well-presented?),   general
(13) disposition / disposal (for example, are they friendly and easy to work with?), special (14) skills /
abilities (for example, are they computer literate, can they drive, or do they speak any other languages?) and
(15) interests / hobbies (what do they like doing in their free time?). They might also consider their family
(16) backing / background (are they married, do they have children?) and (17) medicine / medical history.
The person who most closely (18) suits / matches the (19) profile / criteria decided by the managers will
then be accepted for the job.
Before somebody is (20) offered / suggested the job, s/he is asked to provide (21) referees / references
from people who know him / her (usually a former (22) employer / employee, a (23) colleague / co-
worker, and / or a close friend). Before s/he actually starts working, s/he may go through an (24) induction
/ introduction program  to  learn  more  about  the  company  and  the  job.  Sometimes,  s/he  may  be
given a (25) temporary / temporal contract and obliged to complete a (26) trial / probationary period
(where his / her employers make sure that s/he is suitable for the job) before being offered something that is
more (27) permanence / permanent (a fixed-term or open-ended contract, for example).  After s/he has
been with the company for a while, there will probably be an (28) appraisal / appreciable, to assess how
s/he is getting on. These may be repeated on a regular basis throughout his / her time with the company.

Exercise 1:
Read this extract from a magazine article about travel, and choose the correct words or
expressions in bold. Some of the words / expressions are wrong, some have the wrong
form, and some have been spelt incorrectly. Note that in some cases, both answers are
possible.
Travel 1

More people are traveling (1) abroad / aboard in the 21st century than ever before. Going away
for a week or two's (2) vacating / vacation has never been easier, and the age of (3) mass /
massive tourism has truly arrived! If you prefer the comforts of home and have never been away
before, here's how it works.
If you enjoy the convenience of a (4) packing / package tour (where you pay for your flights,
(5) transfers / transits to and from the airport, and (6) acommodations / accomodations /
accommodations in advance), you simply go to the travel (7) operator / agency, pick up a
(8) brochure / catalog or two, find a (9) destiny / destination and (10) itinerary / itinerant
that suits you, and (11) reserve / book it. You then (12) pay a deposit / make a down
payment, and pay the (13) remainder / balance closer to your travel date. Just before you
(14) leave / depart, your tickets arrive and then you're away. 
If you are an (15) independence / independent traveler who prefers more freedom and
(16) flexibleness / flexibility, log on to the Internet, find a website that sells cheap flights,
choose your (17) departure / departing date and return date, then pay the (18) airfee / airfare.
You will then automatically have an (19) a-ticket / e-ticket logged with the airline. If you choose
a hotel at the same time, your chosen hotel will automatically be informed of your (20) booking
/ reservation. You should also receive (21) consternation / confirmation of everything by email.
Closer to the date of your (22) trip / excursion, some airlines will even let you (23) check in /
check-in online, to save you from waiting in line for ages at the airport (24) terminus / terminal.
(25) Ticketless / Ticketfree travel has eliminated the need for piles of unnecessary paperwork. It's
all so easy!
Or is it? Here are just a few things that you ought to consider (and remember, this all has to be
done before you even get to the airport!).
First of all, you will need to check your passport: have you got one, for a start, and is it still
(26) validated / valid? Most countries will not let you in if your passport (27) runs out / expires
within six months. Secondly, what about a (28) visa / visor? More and more countries require you
to have one, and this will cost you money (and time and effort, too: in some cases, you have to
present yourself in person at the country's (29) emmbassy / embassy). Thirdly, you will need to
get (30) traveler's checks / traveling checks and / or foreign (31) currancy / currency: if you
choose the latter, you need to check the (32) exchange / changing rate to make sure you are
getting a favorable (33) deal / bargain, and then in most cases you will need to pay
(34) comission / commission / commision to the bank who supplies it. Finally, have you got
adequate (35) insurence / insurance / insureance cover, are your (36) vaccinations /
vaccinnations / vacinations up to date, will your mobile phone work abroad, and have you
made (37) arrangments / arangements / arrangements for someone to look after your cat and
dog, and water your plants, while you are away? (continued on page…)

Money matters 1 (page 31)
Exercise 1:
1. If you lend money, you let someone use your money for a certain period of time. If you borrow money, you take someone's money
for a short time (usually paying interest – see number 19) and then repay it. (Note that you lend money to someone, and you borrow
money from someone).
2. Inflation is a state of economy where prices and wages increase (= go up). Deflation is a reduction of economic activity.
3. A discount is the percentage by which a full price is reduced in a shop (if the reduction is very big, we can say that it is a bargain). A
refund is money paid when, for example, returning something to a shop (you will normally need to show a receipt when getting a refund
– see number 8). Note that refund can also be a verb: to refund money.
4. Income is the money you receive (your wage or salary is part of your income). Expenditure is money you spend. Most people would
like their income to be greater than their expenditure.
5. If a company is insolvent, it has lost all its money. If a company is bankrupt, it has lost all its money , it has also borrowed a lot, and
it cannot pay back its debts (= money it owes). Being bankrupt is a very serious financial situation for a company to be in. (Note that a
company goes bankrupt, or is declared bankrupt in a court of law. Bankrupt can also be a verb: the current economic situation has
bankrupted us)
6. A bank statement is a detailed written document from a bank showing how much money has gone into and come out of a bank
account. A balance is the amount of money you have in your bank account.
7. If your bank account is in the red, your expenditure has been greater than your income (see number 4), and so you have less than $0
in your bank account. If your account is in the black, you have more than $0 in your bank account.
8. An invoice is a note, or bill, sent to you to ask for payment for goods or services (it can also be a verb: to invoice someone for
something). A receipt is a note (from a shop, for example) which shows how much you have paid for something.
9. When you make a profit, you gain money from selling something which is more than the money you paid for it. When you make a
loss, you have spent money which you have not gotten back.
10. Gross profit is the profit you make before money is taken away to cover costs of production, labor, tax, etc. Net profit is the money
you are left with after costs, taxes, etc., have been taken away (money which is taken away is called a deduction).
11. If you have been undercharged, you have paid less than you should have for goods or services. If you have been overcharged, you
have paid too much.
12. Something which is overpriced is too expensive. Something which is exorbitant costs much more than its true value (we can also
use the more informal word extortionate).
13. If you save money, you keep it so that you can use it later. If you invest money, you put it into property, stocks, etc., so that it will
increase in value (the noun is investment).
14. A wage and a salary are both money you receive for doing a job, but a wage is usually paid daily or weekly and a salary is usually
paid monthly.
15. Extravagant describes someone who spends a lot of money. Economical (= frugal) describes someone who is careful with money.
16. A loan is money that you borrow to buy something. A mortgage is a special kind of loan used to buy a house or other building over
a period of time.
17. A loan is money you borrow from a bank, and a formal arrangement has been made with the bank for this. An overdraft is the
69
For reference see Easier English Intermediate Dictionary (0-7475-6989-4).
amount of money you withdraw from your bank, which is more than there is your account. It is usually done without making an
arrangement with the bank (although many banks offer their customers automatic overdraft facilities).
18. A share is one of the many equal parts into which a company's capital (= money that is invested in the company) is divided. People
who buy them are called shareholders. A stock is an investment in a company represented by shares. (Note that in the United Kingdom,
stocks are shares which are issued by the government).
19. Commission is the percentage of sales value given to a sales person in a company. Interest is the percentage that is paid to someone
for lending money.
20. A worthless (= valueless) object is something which has no value. A priceless object is an extremely valuable object.
21. When you credit an account, you put money into it. When you debit an account, you take money out of it.
22. A pension is the money that someone continues to receive after they have retired from a job. Redundancy pay is the money that is
given to someone to compensate then for losing their job when a company makes them redundant (= no longer needed). (Note that if
you lose your job and cannot find another one, you can receive welfare (= money from the government)). 
23. A dividend is part of a company's profits shared out among shareholders (see number 18). A royalty is money paid to the author of
a book, an actor, a rock star, etc., as a percentage of sales (it is usually plural: Royalties are paid twice each year).
24. Tax is money taken by the government from incomes, sales, etc., to pay for government services. Duty is a special tax that has to be
paid for bringing goods into a country (it is often called import duty).
25. If you deposit money in an account, you put money into the account. If you withdraw money, you take it out of your account.
26. A bill is a piece of paper showing the amount of money that you have to pay for goods or services (for example, an electricity bill). A
check is a bill that you receive in a restaurant.

1. refund / receipt    2. overcharged / check / tax / exorbitant    3. statement or balance / overdraft / in the red / expenditure    4. gross /

to do anything)

Note that using a word with a similar meaning to another word does not always mean using that word in exactly the same way structurally
or lexically. For example: you can 'prevent a strike from taking place' or you can 'avert a strike' (not 'avert a strike from taking place'); you
can 'suggest something without saying it directly' or you can 'imply something' (not 'imply something without saying it directly'). In these
examples, the words at the end are not necessary because their meaning is carried in the main verb. This is one reason why you should
always record words in context, and with an example that shows how they are used, so that when you use them yourself, you use them
correctly.
