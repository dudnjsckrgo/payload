안녕하세요. 해커스 어학원 강남역 캠퍼스에서 토익 RC를 담당하고 있는 김동 입니다. 
“토익에 대한 자신감은 노력과 정비례한다.”
여러분, 노력과 자신감을 가지고 진심을 다해서 공부해 주시기 바랍니다. 
절대적인 공부양은 여러분들의 노력에 따라 결정됩니다. 토익은 90% 이상이 반복 출제되는 
유형이기 때문에 시간을 많이 투자하면 할수록 그 결과는 좋아집니다. 그리고, 자신감은 노력과 
정비례해서 커집니다. 
불안한 마음으로 시간을 낭비하지 마시기 바랍니다. 노력하면 자신감은 그만큼 커지고 그리고 
분명히 좋은 결과가 여러분들을 기다리고 있을 것입니다.
