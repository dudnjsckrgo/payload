To: Paul Gosslin <gosslin@palmettogroceries.com> 
From: Amanda Hertz <hertz@palmettogroceries.com> 
Subject: New plan 
Date: April 28 
Dear Mr. Gosslin, 
It seems like more and more local grocery stores are 
installing butcher’s counters near their checkout lines.  
---116.---, I would say that these counters have become 
the main attractions at a lot of places. What do you 
think about installing one for ourselves? The idea has

concerns. In light of recent trends, perhaps we should 
reconsider. Installing a counter would be expensive, but 
it would result in an increase in sales revenue. ---118.---. 
To ensure the counter’s success, we should promote it 
heavily in newspapers and in the store itself. We should 
also find a good meat supplier, like Elm Grove Farms. 
Once you give me your approval for this plan, I ---119.--- 
that company and inquire about prices. 
Sincerely, 
Amanda Hertz
